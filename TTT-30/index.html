<p>In today’s 30th issue of Terraria Thursday Thoughts, Nanogamer7 talks about the major influence that the new Steam Workshop will have on the Terraria community and what it could mean for the modding scene in general.</p>

<p>On Monday, Re-Logic <a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/1.4.0.1">announced</a> the addition of Terraria to the Steam Workshop. This is a really big opportunity for the game and could potentially draw many more players into its orbit. Let me explain.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>With <a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/1.4.0.1#:~:text=0.1%20update%2C%20named%20Journey's%20End,major%20feature%20update%20to%20Terraria.">Terraria 1.4</a> being announced as the last major update, fittingly named “Journey’s End”, the game saw a new spike in popularity. It saw almost half a million players at one point, and had a lasting increase of daily players as seen on steamdb.info:</p>

<p>It doesn’t happen all too often that an older and less mainstream game rises to the top again almost ten years after its initial release. In this case however, it isn’t all too surprising. Terraria has sold more than 10 million copies, it has the second highest amount of positive reviews on Steam and the fifth-highest rating overall, only marginally behind games like Portal 2 and Factorio. Announcing the final update to a classic and legendary game will definitely draw a big influx of players to it - former and new players alike.</p>

<p>Now, while sandbox games usually offer unlimited potential, the creativity of the players needs to be stimulated sometimes. Many players will get bored without a change of scenery from time to time, which is exactly what mods bring to the table.</p>

<p>Games with healthy modding communities typically see longer lifetimes. Great examples of this could be Minecraft, Skyrim, or Kerbal Space Program. The base game stands on its own, but with the use of mods the possibilities are almost endless, making people keep playing the game. Terraria also falls in this category, but the built-in tools were arguably quite limited. Until now, only the community-made <a href="https://www.tmodloader.net/">tModLoader</a> provided the ability to easily install and manage mods. Its install process required you to fiddle around with various files and folders, and even though it’s now only one click to install, it being marked as “community-made” in a big yellow text box might still be a bit daunting for inexperienced users.</p>
