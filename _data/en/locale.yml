  ## About

  Alt-F4 is a [weekly blog](http://alt-f4.blog) that's written and edited entirely by the [Factorio](https://factorio.com) community, and features various topics that are relevant to it, such as mod spotlights, community showcases or gameplay columns.

  It is a follow-on to the venerable [Factorio Friday Facts](https://factorio.com/blog/) ('FFF'), which documented the development process of Factorio for 360 weeks. It expressed the developers beliefs about [pricing strategy](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-247), guided us through their crazy [optimization process](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-176), and detailed how a machine design [comes to be](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-351).

  After coming [full circle](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-360) in August 2020 with the proper release of the game, the developers decided to discontinute this habit and take a well-deserved break. The community did not want this tradition to end though, so it [picked up the torch](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/i9pxb3/communityfff/) and [continues on](http://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-1). The focus necessarily shifted from insights into the development to a miscellany of topics that are of interest to the community.
