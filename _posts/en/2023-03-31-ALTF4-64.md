New year, same old Alt-F4! Issue #64 is not just satisfying for lovers of the binary format, but hopefully for everyone else as well. First-time contributor *OceanPhantom* is here to share the exciting recent developments in the space of automating the train network even further via the use of modifications, or mods for short. Can the venerable LTN be dethroned? We'll find out!
