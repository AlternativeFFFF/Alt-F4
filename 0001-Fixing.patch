 # r/place: A Monetary Lapse of Time <author>stringweasel, Mr_George</author>
 
-Over the past weekend most avid redditors had a momentary lapse of time as the world was caught up in r/place. Hundreds of thousands of people were avidly sitting behind their screen. Masses and masses were excitely waiting for their 5 minute timer to run out so that they could place their next little pixel. They weren't neccesarily excited about the pixel itself though. No, it was about being part of the bigger image. Contributing to the common goal of your community. It was about together achieving something great, and leaving something beautiful behind on the r/place canvas.
+Over the past weekend most avid redditors had a momentary lapse of time as the world was caught up in r/place. Millions of people were avidly sitting behind their screen looking at pixelated images. Masses and masses were excitely waiting for their 5 minute timer to run out so that they could place their next pixel. They weren't neccesarily excited about the pixel itself though. No, it was about being part of the bigger image. Contributing to the common goal of your community. It was about together achieving something great, and leaving something beautiful behind on the r/place canvas.
 
 ## What is r/place?
 
-r/place was first seen as a Reddit social experiment for [April Fools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/62mesr/place/) in 2017. It was created by the creator of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/). It's consisted of a single 1000x1000 global canvas which users can the individuak change pixel colours off, but only once every 5 to 20 minutes. It was a massive hit, with over 1 million users interacting with it and about 16 million tiles placed! Communities worked together to create beautiful artwork, and sending the most of Reddit into a frenzy. After three days the canvas was frozen, solidifying all the art created.

-As most communities, the [r/Factorio](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/) community also fought for space on the canvas to show our passion. And our community was strong, even though the game would only be officially released three years later! In the end, one that single canvas, we managed to secure not one, but two locations! One of which was above one of the most famous areas of [The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Darth_Plagueis_the_Wise). Most Factorians massively enjoyed this event. Here is a [nice visualization](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/) about all the different artworks placed in the first event.

-On 28 March 2022, a reboot of r/place was [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/tqbf9w/bringing_back_rplace/) for April Fools. What follows is an epic period of excitement, dread, coorporation and defeat. This article is an attempt to capture most of what happened. It was quite a adventure!

 ## The Journey
 
 ![Timelapse of the our first artwork in r/place 2022](...)
 
-It started with a [thread](https://discord.com/channels/139677590393716737/959132842787487814) by the moderator *SpeckledFleebeedoo* in the Factorio Discord on 31 March in preperation for r/place to start the next day. It was rather quiet, except showing what Factorio did at the previous event. The next, just like 2017, it started with a 1000x1000 canvas and 16 colours. It was time for Factorio to show what it's capable of again! After a brief discussion in our own Alt-F4 Discord server that the first pixel was placed at `{271,555}` by yours truley (*stringweasel* - hi!). The location was forwarded to the Official Discord, and then it all started! There was no official plan yet, so it was decided to write "r/FACTORIO", just like in 2017, except we (I) accidentally inverted the colours. It started to grow steadily as word was spread to start placing pixels, but our reference image was simply a screenshot of 2017. Luckily *ivanjermakov* stepped up became our first blueprint designer by creating the first blueprint.

It was rather quiet, except showing what Factorio did at the previous event. And then very omniously, just like 2017, it started with a 1000x1000 canvas and 16 colours. It was time for Factorio to show what it's capable of again! After a brief discussion in our own Alt-F4 Discord server that the first pixel was placed at `{271,555}` by *stringweasel*.

There was no official plan yet, so it was decided to write "r/FACTORIO", just like in 2017, except we (I) accidentally inverted the colours. It started to grow steadily as word spread to other players to start placing pixels, but our reference image was a hard to use screenshot of 2017. Luckily *ivanjermakov* stepped up became our first blueprint designer by creating the first blueprint.
 
-The canvas was still empty when the initial spot was chosen, but of course, there were always threats for a community to draw over us. The first such threat was the only real other art in the vicinity, the Belgium flag coming up from the South. So peace treaties were sent by (??). It was in this time that the next blueprints were being created to include belts. However, there was a problem with getting the last `O` in Factorio to be a _gear_, because misguided troops were trying to create a normal `O`. This led to some very [strange looking](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959132842787487814/959481710414815232/unknown.png) hoops. It was only after some time that the gear was redesigned and successfully drawn. As soon as the basic idea for the gear was visible (and many DMs sent) the troops finished and defended the gear. Work began on the Northen belt. It started fairly sparked controversy: should the belt have alternating grey-black pixels (similar to 2017) at the bottom or a solid grey line? However, the bigger issue was again that misguided Factorians removed any attempt to bring in the line below the arrows. It was only much later that the belt finally became vertically symmetrical - well after the decision to do a solid-grey line because it's easier.

A even bigger issue was again that misguided Factorians removed any attempt to bring in the line below the arrows anyway. It was only much later that the belt finally became vertically symmetrical - well after the decision to do a solid-grey line was made because it's easier.
 
 Juxtapose: The first official blueprint (left) used on the r/place in 2022, as made by *ivanjermakov*. On the right is one of the last iterations of this blueprint. At the end it had some [underneathies](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/#underneathies) and another blue circuit.
 ![](media/first-blueprint.png)
 ![](media/final-ish-benchy-blueprint.png)
 
-The time of the great belt-controversy was luckily also the time of new friends. Our Northern belt was on it's way to cover the merry green little boat named Benchy - [r/3Dprinting/](r/3Dprinting/)'s infamous mascot. A user named SevenAndAHalf came to ask for peace, because they had to move their beloved Benchy once already. It was excitely decided that we will become friends with them, and have Benchy riding on our belt! However, again, it took some time to convince the isolated troops that the belt should go _behind_ the green boat. Regardless, good relations were established with r/3Dprinting, and many r/Factorio pixels were placed in aid of Chile destroying Benchy's roof. Benchy's bottom even became part of our official blueprint, and SevenAndAHalf became a honourable ally!

Benchy's bottom even became part of our official blueprint, and SevenAndAHalf became a honourable ally!
 
-Soon Benchy was on the belt, and our belt was making it's way around the bottom of our logo. By this time there was three gears ("Factoriooo"?) and it was decided that two of these gears should be replaced by circuit. Yet again, the unamed reddit troops were veciously defendending the gears, making it impossible to draw *ivanjermakov*'s beautiful circuits over it. Here is were our own *Nano* stepped in and created a Google Sheet, where everybody chose a pixel (or few) they could place at the signal. As one voice he and SpeckledFleebeedoo screamed charge, and we all placed our loaded pixels simultaniously. And suddenly a fresh green circuit materialized. Success! This method was used quite often from that point forward, for inserters, science packs, even fish! However, everything wasn't sunshine and roses.

 ![Some streamer decided to execute an unsolicited attack which almost hit us (Image captured by aptly named user [*mxdanger*](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2089903-ralph-in-danger))](media/xqc-threat.png) 
 
-At around 38 hours some streamer name xQcOW released a powerful Purple Void. Big streamers caused a lot of trouble and controversy over the course of r/place, because with tens of thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands!) of viewers they could direct it was too easy for them to completely obliterate smaller communities. And this wasn't the last time we would be under threat of an streamer. Luckily this time the void didn't reach us being defended by our strong neighbours like r/onepiece. It was making friends, strong alliances, with our neighbours that kept our artworks lasting so long. We were also lucky that the streamers were often distracted by the strong communities, like Osu, Star Wars and France, to name a few. Otherwise this location was fairly safe, except for the continual attacks on the US Flag North of us, with Chile ultimately defeating them. There were many concers that over-zealous attackers would barge through our neighbours Besiege and RIT and attack our belts, but this luckily never realized.

 ## Double or Nothing
 
-At around 27 hours the canvas size unexpectedly doubled, the number of colours doubled, and so did the tension. Many communities were scrambling for space while trying to determine what to draw after the initial inrush of trolls and flags. Even in our community tensions were high because there were suddenly many excited voices with design ideas and attack plans on what to do in this new space. After some floudering we ended up securing `{1600,550}`, because as *Stuckey* suggested, this would allow the possibility of connecting an underground belt to our previous location which is at the same y-level! Thus, a plan was put kicked into action. We will secure the area with belts initially, as laid out by *pg*'s blueprints, while we wait for *ivanjermakov* pixelated intepretation of the Factorio gear. This gear blueprint was later improved by *apatton* which used only 5 colours, which looked nicer and was easier to defend.

After some floundering we ended up securing the area around `{1600,550}`, because as *Stuckey* suggested, this would allow the possibility of connecting an underground belt to our Western location which is at the same y-level! Thus, a plan was put kicked into action. We will secure the area with belts initially, as laid out by *pg*'s blueprints, while we wait for *ivanjermakov* pixelated intepretation of the Factorio gear.

 ![The Gear just after initial construction amidst of fighting of a Black Void.](media/gear-short-after%20construction.png)
 
-As you might know, the area was secured successfully. Allies were made, battles were faught, and pixels were lost, as told later. However, first doubling of the size wasn't the last of the tricks up Reddit's sleeve. No, after around 54 hours the canvas doubled in size yet again, now being 2000x2000 pixels! And there was so much open space, which for a long time was wild with flags and amongus. Luckily, this move was anticipated by the Factorio community, and we had a plan! As *Mr_George* mentioned, in order to build big, we need to build together. A type of artwork shared between different communities. The *Nano* made a great suggestion to build a train. We build our famous locomotive, and then other communities can drive on the wagons! Quickly the [talented](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bumble-bots) Discord moderator, *Maxreader*, drew up beautiful pixel-art showing this idea. We also reached out to potential partners for this project, including communities like Mindustry, Unturned, Sea of thieves, Germany, Risk of Rain, India and Furry_irl.

 ![The mockup of our train with custom wagons for furry_irl and Mindustry. Unfortunately only the Mindustry wagon materials](media/wagon-mockup.png) 
 
-This time, as the canvas doubled again, we were much quicker in securing location around `{500, 1200}` (location again recommended by *Stuckey*). The problem was that, so were everybody else! Were quickly ran out of room and were tucked in tightly - next to quite salacious neighbour. There was also a potential collision with the Risk of Rain community who was constructing a figure over the nose of our locomotive. They were contacted and in a successful piece deal it was agreed that they would move their figure over pixels lower, and then get a dedicated wagon. That allowed us to finish the locomotive and first wagon, occupied by our friends Mindustry. We tried to build more wagons for more allies. We even contacted the Portal Comunity to build a portal for for the train to drive through, which would allow us to build more wagons. They were too busy though, because the were already doing three big projects at the time. This forced the Furry_irl, Unturned and Risk of Rain communities to unfortunately give up on the wagon project.

 ![Timelapse showing the lifetime of The Train](...)
 
-Finally, as you might notice in the timelapse above, the train lost it's nose at some point. This was much closer to a stampede than a battle after another unfortunate event. On the right there were a beautiful big Mexican flag, which wasn't threatening our train. This flag was likely kept from expanding further left by our tantalizing Southern neighhbour. However, this Southern neighbour was being vandalized, which at some point triggered a vigilante community to completely remove it. The problem is that this provided space for the Mexican streamer to expand left to it's full size. And in the blink of the eye the locomotive's nose was cut off. There was attempts by us, and even the Mexican Discord who were one of our allies, to keep the train, but it was unsuccessful.

+However, this might have been a blessing in disguise, because all focus was required at the gear. It was mayhem.
 
 ## The War of the Nut
 
-Here is told the story of the War of the Nut. Not a lonely battle, but war, because it was endless battles around the the Factorio Gear on the second canvas expansion. Our gear, or as our enemies mistakenly knew it as: [The Nut](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecuador/comments/tw2iam/conquistemos_esa_parte_de_ah%C3%AD_hagan_una_nueva/).

Our gear, or as our enemies mistakenly knew it as, [The Nut](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecuador/comments/tw2iam/conquistemos_esa_parte_de_ah%C3%AD_hagan_una_nueva/), which we worked really hard to construct.
 
 ![Timelapse showing the lifetime of our monument, beacon of hope, our Gear](...)
 
-As mentioned earlier the area was originally secured using belts. This was a good strategy because space was very quickly being clamed by other communities. The improved gear logo was also well liked by the community, and construction started soon after the space was secure. However, construction was only about half-way before the first attack - The Void. It already heavily damaged our neighbour - *#100Devs*. Luckily, we sent spies into The Void's Discord, who discreetly relayed the information to us, so we knew their plan. This is where good allys and deep friendships were created, because as a combined effort between Pikmin, Danidev, #100Devs and even Norway, we were able to fight of The Void! They seem to have accepted defeat, and rather redirected their attacks in a Northern direction. With the help of our new friends, we defended our belts, and soon our Gear was completed.

 People around us seemed to really enjoy the gear, because soon our neighbour Romania's ambassador *Ironic_Onion* contacted us. They proposed that we should expand our belts over their flag, but only if we matched their colors with their flag. And so another aliance started with Romania! Construction on our new belts were well underway when a new foe approached. Ecuador. A country with almost 18.6 million people, and they were approaching fast, while our troops started their defending calls. The problem was that the people weren't online - meaning they weren't on a single united Discord server. And on the [r/Ecuador](r/Ecuador) subreddit removed all posts related to r/place. The chances of peace talks looked dismal. So dismal in fact, that our official Ambassador *Mr_George* started a long search to get in touch with the Ecuadorians, even joining six of their Discords. However, negotiations with Ecuador were too difficult to establish. The Discords were occationally agreeing to peace and maybe ally with us, but it did not stop the Ecuadorian Hivemind. Many hours later, it seemed that all peace talks were forgotten, because they attacked again! This time their attack was more powerful. They destroyed DaniDev started removing our belts. Again our ambassodor *Mr_George* jumped between their servers frantically to make achieve piece. There was even a half-cog-half-heart shrine created to show good faith, but to no prevail. We admitted defeat, and after they built their letters into our territory they stopped luckily.
