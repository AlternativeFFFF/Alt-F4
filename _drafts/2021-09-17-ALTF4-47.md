After a three-week hiatus, Alt-F4 is back, more motivated than ever! We start off with a bang as *ilbJanissary* goes into depth about how the calculation engine behind [FactorioLab](https://factoriolab.github.io) does its magic. It might seem complicated at the surface, but the process is broken down into granular parts that are illustrated with actual examples. No eyes will glaze over reading this piece (hopefully!).
