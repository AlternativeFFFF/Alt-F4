Welcome to the shark-filled issue #2<sup>5</sup> of Alt-F4. In these treacherous waters, *The-Kool* guides us towards putting speakers to good use, maybe even as a shark-warning-system, in the latest episode of Complexity Corner! Then, *Hornwitser* gets to some actual shark hunting using Wireshark, telling the story of how he tracked down network issues he encountered with the game. Grab a harpoon and jump in!
