In the middle of May, in a very expected fashion, issue #35 of Alt-F4 is here for you to consume through your eyeballs. On offer is a scientific exploration by *Romner* of why exactly the Factorio engineer is much more of a chad than Minecraft Steve. To round this feast for the senses out, *Conor_* then gives us a glimpse into the *Hall of Fame* mod by *stringweasel* which is *totally* not *nepotism* at *all*.
