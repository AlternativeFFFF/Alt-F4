Today we've got a very fun project to talk about: The FUE5 project, explained in this article by *Hurricane*. It's Factorio, but *3D*! Dreams do come true sometimes. It's not quite a game, but more of a stunning re-imagining of its visuals. There's lots of technical details on how this was achieved, so let's jump in.
