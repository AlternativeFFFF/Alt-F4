For the last Alt-F4 of the year, on the very last day of the year, we wanted to take a look back at *ye olden* days of Factorio. Back when it was still a diamond in the rough, with definite potential, but concrete issues and annoyances as well. We hit up various people in the community and got their hot takes on early Factorio, reminiscing about the time they got into the game, and about how things changed for the better.
