In this week's issue #42 of Alt-F4, after [previously](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-34/) investigating the games that influenced Factorio, we'll now be looking at how Factorio influenced the automation genre as a whole, if that's even a thing. Maybe it isn't. After 7.5 million years of contemplation, *Nanogamer7* has an answer, and it might surprise you.
