This fine week in March, first-time contributor Ph.X talks about their very compartmentalized system for laying out a base using isolated modules and connecting them through a Logistic Train Network. Taking inspiration from software development and the lessons learned there, Ph.X uses the concepts of Modular Programming to their advantage.

Also, in other news, we now offer an email list that you can subscribe to! If you don't browse reddit or the forums or even our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nxnCFkb) regularly, we now offer the option of the ever-popular concept of an email list. Just enter your email [here](https://www.freelists.org/list/alt-f4) and you'll be notified every Friday on release of the newest issue. We will of course only ever use this for Alt-F4 posts, and not spam you with irrelevant crap.
