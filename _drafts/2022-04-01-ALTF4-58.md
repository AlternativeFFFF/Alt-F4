For no special reason, on this particular Friday, *Sir Fendi* took it upon himself to highlight up a few humorous mods that might not be useful, but sure are fun. We'll will start with mods that only change visuals or audio to add some unique flavors to your eningeering experiences. Afterwards, we'll look at some crazy new weapons that spice up the way you do combat. Finally, there's a mod with a level of transportation pizzazz that Willy Wonka himself would be proud of. Silliness is guaranteed!
