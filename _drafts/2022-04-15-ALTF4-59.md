A couple of weeks after the chaos that was r/place, resident historian *stringweasel* took it upon himself to go through the chronology of how the Factorio community tried to leave its mark on the canvas. Battles were fought, alliances were forged, and a lot of fun was had! If the article reminded you of a fun story about r/place that you want to share, we'd love to hear about it on Reddit or our Discord, both of which are linked at the bottom.
