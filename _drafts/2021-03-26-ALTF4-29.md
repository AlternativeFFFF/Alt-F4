This week, for issue #29, we have a rare double feature again! First up, TheKool, who can't stop talking about modules, rounds out his *Complexity Corner* saga by talking about beacons and what they are good for. Then, oof2win2 returns to put the spotlight on their mod *No Belts*, which offers a very interesting alternative perspective on playing the game.
