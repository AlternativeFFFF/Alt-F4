This week, with 1.1 experimental just released, we take a look at two of the things it brings with it. First, *Conor_* investigates what the new train stop limit allows him to do in his TSM-based factory. Then, *Therenas* explores what the multithreading update to belts means, both in theory and in practice. Careful, you might just learn something!
