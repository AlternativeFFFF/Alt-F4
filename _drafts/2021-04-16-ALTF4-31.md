After a quick one-week break, Alt-F4 is back with issue #31. In it, *pocarski* returns to talk about yet more ways to build computer logic in Factorio, featuring combinators this time, which turn out to be simpler to use than you'd think! Afterwards, *Big Community Games* announce another exciting event of theirs, this time with Industrial Revolution as the central focus.
