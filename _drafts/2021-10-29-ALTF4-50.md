This week is the golden anniversary of Alt-F4, it being issue #50 and all. No special festivities though, feels like we are doing that often enough. Instead, *garr890354839* makes their first contribution by talking about some of the weirdnesses and some of the math surrounding rocket silos. Then, *everLord* introduces another community event by the comfy squad called 'Biter Battle Championship'!
