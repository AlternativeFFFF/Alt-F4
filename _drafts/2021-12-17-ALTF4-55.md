For issue #55 of Alt-F4, *stringweasel* prepared a very special treat for everyone, getting various modders to talk about the deepest, dankest hacks they've come up with to make their mods work. We've got MagmaMcFry, raiguard, Deadlock989, Anachrony, PFQNiet, and Earendel all confessing their sins!
