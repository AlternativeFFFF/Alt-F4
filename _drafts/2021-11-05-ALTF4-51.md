For issue #51 of Alt-F4, long-time contributor and editor extraordinaire *stringweasel* delights us with a deep dive into the history of mods trying to make Factorio power network management more realistic. All of them have their own issues and trade-offs, which is why he then introduces his own take at this age-old problem, with great results!
