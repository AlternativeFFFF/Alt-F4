As the year draws to a close, we picked two mod-related topics for this week’s 18th issue of Alt-F4. First, _Hornwitser_ gives us some insight into the long development progress of Clusterio 2.0 and the challenges that it poses. Then, _DedlySpyder_ talks about their process of developing a simple mod and the compatibility challenges they face.

## Contributing

As always, we’re looking for people that want to contribute to Alt-F4, be it by submitting an article or by helping with translation. If you have something interesting in mind that you want to share with the community in a polished way, this is the place to do it. If you’re not too sure about it we’ll gladly help by discussing content ideas and structure questions. If that sounds like something that’s up your alley, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/nxnCFkb) to get started!

As next Friday falls on Christmas Day, we decided not to release an issue that week, meaning this is the last issue of Alt-F4 for this year! We’ll be making our glorious return on the first of January with a bit of a special episode looking back at the how the project has developed so far, with perspectives from various team members about the work they’ve been doing. Should be fun.
