Welcome to the fourth issue of Alt-F4, rounding out the very first month of posts! This week, gamebuster800 describes their process for designing blueprints, Landmine752 shares some of their favourite fan art, and Romner gives us some insight into their Realistic Fusion Power mod (in the first part of a two-part series).

Also, Alt-F4 is now available in five languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian and French) thanks to the effort of many dedicated translators that jumped in to help immediately. You guys are great, thank you. If you, dear reader, want to help translate into even more languages, take a look at the Contributing section below.

We also got translation going last week and it was great to see the enthusiastic support of the many of you who jumped in to help immediately.
