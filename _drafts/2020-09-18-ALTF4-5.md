Welcome to the fifth issue of Alt-F4, and we're still picking up steam! Many contributors, translators and techies are being busy bees, helping to further the project, which is just great. If you want to join in on the fun, check out the 'Contributing'-section at the end. In actual news this week, pocarski makes his case for allowing landfill to be dug up again, Romner follows up his submission from [last week](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-4/#mod-spotlight-realistic-fusion-power-romner) by talking about obliterating biters with your new-found powers, and Dr.MagPie takes us to the Factorio Zone!
