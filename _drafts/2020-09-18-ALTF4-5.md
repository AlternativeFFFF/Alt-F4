Welcome to the fifth issue of Alt-F4, and we're still picking up steam! Many contributors, translators and techies are being busy bees, helping to further the project, which is just great. If you want to join in on the fun, check out the 'Contributing'-section at the end. In actual news this week, pocarski makes his case for allowing landfill to be dug up again, Romner follows up his submission from [last week](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-4/#mod-spotlight-realistic-fusion-power-romner) by talking about obliterating biters with your new-found powers, and Dr.MagPie takes us to the Factorio Zone!

## A small rant about landfill <author>pocarski</author>

"Your mistakes have no cost but time", says [u/talrich](https://www.reddit.com/user/talrich)'s quote on the [Factorio subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/). And yes, for almost anything you do in this game, you can undo your actions at any point. That is true for everything you can build, except for one thing: landfill. While placing any other entity or tile in the wrong spot costs you only a second of your time, doing that with landfill will not only make you irreversibly lose the quite expensive landfill, but it also leaves you with an awkward landmass that you didn't want and now can't remove. In this article, I will be presenting the issues irreversible landfill creates, and hopefully the benefits of making it removable will become clear to you, dear reader.

### Outdated mechanic

While not being able to dig up landfill was perfectly justified in the pre-0.17 days, back when landfill was literally just the default `grass-1` tile, in 0.17.10 it was separated into its own distinct tile. Along with allowing landfill to be placed by bots and included in blueprints in 0.17.0, this set up the perfect condition for also removing landfill or at least allowing us to do something to it that can't be done to other tiles.

### Expensive mistake

Each piece of landfill costs an entire 20 stone to make, meaning an entire 800k stone patch is only enough to landfill a 200 by 200 square, which is really not that much considering the sizes of builds people make. A long time ago I made a nuclear reactor design that required a whopping *2700 landfill*, and it only made 480 MW! There isn't much talking needed to describe the pain of placing a blueprint comparable to that 1 tile off at first and having somewhere around 50 landfill (that is literally **1000 stone**!) just sitting there unused and not available to you anymore.

### Messes with offshore pump placement

Now since I mentioned nuclear power, time to talk about what allows most big reactor builds to work: internal offshore pumps. They are offshore pumps included in the blueprint itself that rely on the shape of the landfill island to pump water properly. It only takes you to accidentally drag the blueprint while placing, and you've already ruined the entire landfill base. In the best case, you can just move some pumps and it will still work, and in the worst case you filled in a critical hole and now the entire platform is unusable and has to just sit there empty and be a massive eyesore.

Related to that is the fact that you can landfill around an existing offshore pump, but that pump can't be placed back if ever removed. What this means is that if you ever have to place anything directly next to an offshore pump, you *have* to place landfill there first, since offshore pumps can only be placed if surrounded by water. This means you have to commit to that pump being there, and if you ever remove it, you'll have to do some intense head scratching to figure out how to route the water from a different pump.

### Conclusion

- Irreversible landfill is an outdated mechanic that can and should be revised
- Misplacing landfill is extremely expensive, since it can't be recycled once used
- Misplacing a blueprint that contains landfill can often ruin entire projects

Landfill is the only placeable object in the game that requires full commitment from the player. As someone suffering from commitment issues, I avoid placing landfill in freeplay at all costs, and personally, I don't think this is how any game mechanic should be treated. Letting us dig up landfill will absolutely improve the game (and in the rare case the player removes landfill under themself and dies it's gonna be their own fault). Of course, there is always the "if you want removable landfill, just install some mods" argument, but I feel like that goes against Wube's philosophy of making a polished game.

## Mod Spotlight: [Realistic Fusion Weaponry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionWeaponry) <author>Romner</author>

After I made the [power mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower), featured in [last weeks](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-4/#mod-spotlight-realistic-fusion-power-romner) issue of Alt-F4, I wondered if it's possible to use fusion for something else than just power production. Well, thermonuclear bombs are already a thing. Pure fusion bombs are theoretical, but I added them anyways. I'll let the gifs do the talking:

![](nukes-old.gif)
![](nukes-new.gif)

The order goes vanilla nuke > thermonuclear bomb > pure fusion bomb. The first gif shows vanilla-like explosions, while for the second one, I created kind of a meld of [MIRV](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/MIRV)'s and vanilla 1.0's explosions. I personally like the MIRV-like ones more, but if you don't, there's a setting for each bomb. There's also a setting to change the strength of the screen burn if it's too much for you.

I recently added antimatter to [Realistic Fusion Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower). Antimatter can be used for a lot of power production or for powerful weapons. *Very* powerful weapons. (Gif was sped up to account for UPS drops)

![](antimatter-bomb.gif)

The antimatter bomb is only launchable as an artillery shell because there's no way you could survive after launching it from a handheld rocket launcher. Pure fusion and antimatter weaponry also has no critical mass (unlike fission and thermonuclear), which means they can be scaled down to practically any size. That includes:

Small rockets (and cannon shells which create the same explosion):

![](rocket.gif)

shotgun shells:

![](shotgun-fusion.gif)
![](shotgun-antimatter.gif)

and even bullets!

![](bullets-fusion.gif)
![](bullets-antimatter.gif)

There isn't a antimatter rocket/cannon shell GIF because it makes an explosion the same size as the pure fusion bomb.
And did I mention that all the nukes have artillery shell counterparts? Yes, even the vanilla one.

Also, you know flamethrowers, right? Well, why throw thousands of degrees hot flames when you can throw millions (or even billions!) of degrees hot plasma?

![](plasma-thrower.gif)

And yes, there's a plasma thrower turret too. They use either D or He-3 plasma (He-3 deals higher damage because of the 4x higher temperature). (Yes, I know plasma is just hot gas that would cool down very quickly, so in reality, it would just be a fart thrower but with the power of Science™, you managed to make it, well, *not* do that.)

Of course, all of this isn't cheap - there are several researches, costing 10k (plasma throwers), 20k (thermonuclear bomb), 50k (pure fusion bomb), 100k (small scale fusion weaponry), 500k (small scale antimatter weaponry) and 1M (antimatter bomb) science each. For comparison, the vanilla nuke needs 5k. Their recipes are also quite expensive: a single thermonuclear bomb needs 10k of the deuterium-tritium mixture + 25 u-235. That is 2TJ worth of fusion fuel and 2TJ of fission fuel. The pure fusion bomb needs 20k of the deuterium-helium-3 mixture, that's 20TJ worth of fusion fuel. The antimatter bomb uses 500 antihydrogen. That's ~386TJ. The vanilla nuke has 2.4TJ worth of fission fuel.

RFW is meant to be used against powerful modded enemies (like [Rampant](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rampant)'s), but you can of course use it with vanilla too (assuming you have [Realistic Fusion Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower) installed, it's an addon to it after all).

## Service: [Factorio Zone](https://factorio.zone) <author>Dr.MagPie</author>

Always wanted to play on a Factorio server with your friends, but don't have the funds to afford one? Well, there is an option available to you: Factorio Zone! It allows you to host your own, free server.

The service is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and WhiteFang, the developer of the service, has optimized it and dropped costs down, so at the moment he does not mind covering costs for running it as a contribution to Factorio community.

Using it is pretty straight forward. You just go to [factorio.zone](https://factorio.zone), where you can upload your save and mods. Factorio Zone does not update mods for you, so you will have to do that manually. Don't worry about accidentally closing the tab with the server, a it creates a Unique User ID aka. a token which is stored in your browser's local storage. When you open Factorio Zone next time, it will remember your save and mods.

As it is a free service, there are some limitations in place. If a server has no players on it for an hour, the service will shut it down and store the save file. If a player is idle for 30 minutes then they'll be kicked from the server. When there are no players on a server, it'll pause to protect your base from being overrun by biters.

It's worth mentioning that Factorio Zone estimates the server size to use based on the map and mods. So it'll scale with your progression (between restarts) and should work for most saves most of the time. There are a few cases it doesn't estimate correctly, but I personally did not encounter any issues with it.

Also, there are some semi-hacky ways to share your session with your friends. So any of you could start or stop the same server at any time. For that, you just need to extract and share the above-mentioned token. To do that, you can use [this tool](https://github.com/Rubydesic/factorio-zone-change-token). There also is a [great tool](https://gist.github.com/leonard84/b31b3b9fb70fb737bb250bbf893a04d2) that will help you to prepare mods to be used on Factorio Zone. It does some optimizations to the file sizes like removing assets which will not be used by the server anyways.

So if that sounds interesting to you, give it a spin, and consider thanking/supporting the developer WhiteFang for providing this to the community for free.
