For this issue of Alt-F4 we decided to do something special: ask the community why exactly they love this game so much. Everyone was invited to submit a short piece detailing their absolute favourite thing about Factorio, which many promptly did. Hereâ€™s to one of the greatest games of all time, and to the dedicated team that made it a reality these last eight years!
