For this issue of Alt-F4, we decided to do something special: Ask the community about why exactly they love this game so much. Everyone got to submit a short piece detailing their absolute favorite thing about Factorio, which many promptly did. Here's to one of the greatest games of all time, and to the dedicated team that made it a reality these last 8 years!
