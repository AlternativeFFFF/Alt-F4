After a somewhat lengthy pause, Alt-F4 returns with an issue reminiscent of the good ol' FFF: A dev blog! Only here, it's not about the game itself, but a very unique and slightly crazy mod. *Credne* brought **Dana** into this world, and it took quite a bit of doing to get there. Lots of technical detail and cribbing ideas from Football ahead, so dive in!
