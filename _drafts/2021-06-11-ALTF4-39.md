In this week's issue of Alt-F4 #39, which is divisible by 13 (quick maffs), *Drogiwan Cannobi* makes their first contribution to the project by elaborating on the background and on the inner workings of his Rube-Goldberg-esque self-expanding factory that's lovingly titled JOSEF. It's a really cool concept that is not even that complicated once you get down to the details.
