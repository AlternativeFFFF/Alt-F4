Welcome to the third issue of Alt-F4. This weekend, there'll be an attempt to try and break the record for the highest number of players on a single Factorio server; read on for details of how to join the fun. There's also an action report about the Big Community Games launch party, which should totally haven been covered last week. Completely my (Therena's) bad. Finally, Raiguard shares an exciting mod of his with all of us. Let's get to it!

 PS: We're looking for motivated people that want to help translate each issue of Alt-F4. If you're interested, you can find more info at the end of this issue. Thanks!



## Contributing

We're always looking for people that have something interesting they want to share with the Factorio community. If that's you, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AsXAwyV) (or the [GitHub project](https://github.com/AlternativeFFFF/Alt-F4)) to get started. Pretty much any topic is welcome, so don't be afraid to contribute!

We're also looking at getting community translations started this week, which would make Alt-F4 available to many more people than just the English version could. We have already set the website up to accommodate this, so all we need are people to work on the translations. If you're up for it, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZpNzmN6) and look for the #translation channel.
