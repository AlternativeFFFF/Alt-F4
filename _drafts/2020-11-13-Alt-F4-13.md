On this spookily coincidental issue number 13 of Alt-F4, on a Friday the 13th (it's almost like we planned this), we focus on just one topic: Building as many rocket defences as possible. What are rocket defences, you ask? Well, stringweasel is here to tell you, taking you back to a simpler time; to the land of Factorio 0.11.
