## One year of Alt-F4 <author>Conor_</author>

Goddam, one full year of Alt-F4. 45 releases across the last 52 weeks, each and every one celebrating the awesome community around Factorio.

Total word count?

contributors!!!!!

## Highlights

One of the most fun parts of each week for me comes on Thursday when we have to select the title and thumbnail for that week's release. This is the time the editing team get to be creative and make something fun and interesting to surround the week's submission. The title and thumbnail are what people see to intrigue them into reading the submission that was so carefully put together by the contributor, so we think its super important to get it right. _Nano_ and _stringweasel_ are usually taking the lead on design of the thumbnail, pouring their memes and dreams into their creations. Below, I've created a collage of all the thumbnails up to this point to show them off in all their glory. If any happen to intrigue you, feel free to click on through to that weeks article, I can assure you it'll be good!
