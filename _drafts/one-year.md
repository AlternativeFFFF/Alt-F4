## One year of Alt-F4 <author>Conor_</author>

Goddamn. One full year of Alt-F4. 45 releases across the last 52 weeks, each and every one celebrating the awesome community around Factorio. From [SPIDERTRON!!](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-2/) to [Space Exploration](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-14/#mod-spotlight-space-exploration-ironic-toblerone), from [Belt-Based Chaos](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-23/) to [other more different Belt-Based Chaos](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-24/). Between all the contributors, we've written over 100,000 words, quite the accomplishment in my book.

### Some Thanks

None of this would've been possible without the awesome team behind Alt-F4. A special thank you is needed to *stringweasel* for going out and finding interesting people to contribute to Alt-F4, then guiding them through the writing process to produce well-refined articles. Another thank you is needed for *Nano* who's fact checking our releases each week to make sure every obscure link and dumb joke goes where its supposed to, and of course his input in guiding the editorial direction of Alt-F4. And finally, a thank you to *Firerazer* for his hard working managing the translations efforts of Alt-F4.

### Woah, that thumbnail looks weird

One of the most fun parts each week for me comes on Thursday when we have to select the title and thumbnail for that week's release. This is the time the editing team get to be creative and make something fun and interesting to surround that week's submission. The title and thumbnail are what people see to intrigue them into reading the submission that was so carefully put together by the contributor, so we think its super important to get it right. *Nano* and *stringweasel* are usually taking the lead on design of the thumbnail, pouring their memes and dreams into their creations. Below, I've created a collage of all the thumbnails up to this point to show them off in all their glory. If any happen to intrigue you, feel free to click on through to that weeks article, I can assure you it'll be good!

### The Future of Alt-F4

The reality of the Alt-F4 project from the [very begining](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-1/) has been (*to quote the one and only Therenas*) **We Need You!**. Without the army of contributors beavering away on submissions, Alt-F4 won't be able to keep going. This does unfortunately mean that some day, Alt-F4 will end. I hope that day is not soon, and to avoid it coming sooner, we need people to keep on finding cool stuff to write about. It doesn't matter if you're bad at writing or haven't fully fleshed out the idea. We have a team of people dedicated to helping guide you through the writing process. If you have an idea, join our [Discord](https://alt-f4.blog/discord) and get to work!

So as long as people keep writing awesome submissions, the editing and technical teams will keep on working to make them the best they can be, continuing this awesome project. Thank you all for reading, contributing, and giving feedback!
