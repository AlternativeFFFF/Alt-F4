This week, we're back to our regularly scheduled programming with another episode of our favorite series: The Nauvis Archives! *stringweasel* cracks open the history books once again to look at some old mods, and how they eventually became part of the vanilla experience. At the end, we have a quick poll for you, dear reader; we'd appreciate it if you could take the two minutes to answer those questions.
