Welcome to the tenth edition of Alt-F4, breaking into double digits for the first time! This week, Recon419A returns to present a compelling argument, this time about how you should go about setting up the borders of your empire. Next, trupen does some science and dives into some of the rare annoying aspects of Factorio. Lastly, stringweasel has some corrections of [last week’s](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/) issue of Alt-F4 on the origins of Nauvis.
