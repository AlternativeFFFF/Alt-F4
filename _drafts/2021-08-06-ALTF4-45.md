For issue #45, Alt-F4 has another mod spotlight to share, with the twist that the issue will be released alongisde the [mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Satisfactorio) itself! *Niet* has been plugging away at bringing some of Satisfactory's mechanics to Factorio, and it's way more involved than just bringing over the recipes and calling it a day. The article below goes into all the tricks that are used to try and emulate another game as closely as possible.
