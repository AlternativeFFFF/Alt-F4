Another week, another issue of Alt-F4! The sixteenth week of this merry series of words to be precise. To celebrate, TheKool continues his Complexity Corner series by asking the [five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) about speed modules. Afterwards, DedlySpyder pontificates on how modding inspiration sometimes comes from unexpected places.
