Welcome to the eleventh edition of Alt-F4, bringing you both mathematical analysis and a history lession, so listen up,  student! Pocarski took it upon himself to see if real world mathematics work out on Nauvis. Spoiler alert: They don't. Then, stringweasel returns once again to take a look at a bit of history, this time focusing on past mechanics that are now long obsolete.
