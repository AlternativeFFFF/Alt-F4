For the very prime real estate of issue #53 of Alt-F4, grandmaster *Therenas* himself returns to grace us with another article. Following up his [previous](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-1/) [masterpieces](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-17/) that mostly talk about his own mods, here's more words about exactly those things. Those words explore the topic of automatically taking screenshots in Factorio. Although it's really only about 2% technical details, with 4% philosophy and 5% bad jokes. You read that right, it goes to 11!
