In issue #43 of Alt-F4, mod-maker extraordinaire *Dysoch* talks about his history of modding (which started all the way back in Factorio 0.7!), giving a bit of an overview of how his mods evolved over time. Then, he goes into his latest and greatest project that's due for release very soon. It's a big overhaul mod that's focused on an overarching story with the goal to be more immersive than previous big mods. More on the details below!
