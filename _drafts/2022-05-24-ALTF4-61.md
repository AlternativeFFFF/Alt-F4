For this week's issue of Alt-F4, we return to the roots of being a spiritual successor to the *FFF* by going deep on a technical topic. To that end, *redruin1* presents his newest invention: Factorio Draftsman. Sure, there have been other projects trying to build a library for generating blueprints for the game, but this one tries to be the new gold standard. Motivations, technical details, and a few fun projects realized with it - all that, and more, this week!
