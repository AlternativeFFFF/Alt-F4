This week, for issue #41, *oof2win2* returns with a somewhat more technical article about what exactly can go wrong when trying to connect to multiplayer games and how to potentially solve these issues. If you've ever wondered why Factorio wouldn't let you join your friends' multiplayer game, this article might have some explanations for you!
