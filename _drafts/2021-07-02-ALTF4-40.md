After a semi-intentional two-week mid-summer break, Alt-F4 makes its glorious return with issue #40. In it, fan-favorite and editor extraordinaire *stringweasel* does another one of his interviews that gets us some perspective on a Nauvis-related topic. A Nauvian Perspective, if you will. This time, he talked to *Franqly* who'll be representing Factorio for the first time at the Summer Games Done Quick charity event. More info on that at the end!
