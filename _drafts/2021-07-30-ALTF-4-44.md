You remember April Fool's day this year? Was quite a while ago already, but if you visited the subreddit on that day, you probably saw *arrow in my gluteus maximus*'s mind-bending video. If not, this week's issue #44 of Alt-F4 will catch you up and then go over how exactly this dark magic presentation was achieved!
