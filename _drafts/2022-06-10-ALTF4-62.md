This week's issue #62 is an exciting one, as first-time contributor *OneCruelBagel* makes their debut by tackling a question that a lot of you probably asked yourselves at some point: What's the difference between some of these big modpacks again? And why might I enjoy one over the other? *OneCruelBagel* played through a few of the big ones, and offers a comprehensive answer to those questions.
