Another week, another Alt-F4 ...? I guess we've been away for a while. It's totally because we didn't want to steal the spotlight from the [FFF](https://factorio.com/blog/), which returned this year! Either way, let's stop distracting from the great piece we *do* have this week: First-time contributor *Sir Fendi* wrote a very detailed piece on nuclear power in Factorio. It sometimes seems like the red-headed stepchild of power generation, but as Sir Fendi explains, there's a lot of fun and efficiency to be had with it!
