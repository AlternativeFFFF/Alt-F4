For this week’s issue of Alt-F4, _Therenas_ takes a page out of the FFF playbook and talks about the development process of the next big update for his mod Factory Planner, going into his somewhat philosophical thoughts on interface design. _Dr_Doof_ also shares a cosy little Christmas event with us, organised by the Red Circuit crew.
