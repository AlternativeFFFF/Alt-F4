After our special [love letter issue](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-8/) last week, we're back to your regularly scheduled programming this week with issue number nine! TheEnemy42 gives us some insight on how the crowdsourced process of translating Factorio into many different languages works, and stringweasel continues his [Nauvis Archives](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-6/#nauvis-archives-how-far-weve-come-stringweasel) series by digging into the origins of some of the language that has developed around the game. Enjoy!
