# Factorio's Journey r/place

The annouce

## What is r/place?

Here is a [nice visualization](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/) about all the different artworks placed in the first event.

And here is what we created now!

## The Conception

It started with a [thread](https://discord.com/channels/139677590393716737/959132842787487814) in the Factorio Discord on 31 March in preperation for r/place to start. However, nothing happened initially, except showing what Factorio did at the previous event. It was only after a brief discussion in our own Alt-F4 Discord server that the first pixel was placed at `{271,555}` by stringweasel. This was then forwarded to the main Discord, and it all started! The reference image was simply the picture of what was used in 2017, but soon ivanjermakov stepped up became our dedicated blueprint designer by creating the first blueprint seen below:

The canvas was still empty when the initial spot was chosen, but of course, there were always threats for a community to draw over us. The first such threat was the only real other art in the vicinity, the Belgium flag coming up from the South. So peace treaties were sent by (??). It was in this time that the next blueprints were being created to include belts. However, there was a problem with getting the last `O` in Factorio to be a _gear_, because misguided troops were trying to create a normal `O`. It was only after some time that the gear was redesigned and successfully drawn. As soon as the basic idea for the gear was visible (and many DMs sent) the troops finished and defended the gear.
