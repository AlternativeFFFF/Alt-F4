# r/place: A Monetary Lapse of Time <author>stringweasel, Mr_George</author>

Over the past weekend most avid redditors had a momentary lapse of time as the world was caught up in r/place. Hundreds of thousands of people were avidly sitting behind their screen. Masses and masses were excitely waiting for their 5 minute timer to run out so that they could place their next little pixel. They weren't neccesarily excited about the pixel itself though. No, it was about being part of the bigger image. Contributing to the common goal of your community. It was about together achieving something great, and leaving something beautiful behind on the r/place canvas.

## What is r/place?

The annoucement was at ??.  Here is a [nice visualization](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/) about all the different artworks placed in the first event.

And here is what we created now!

## The Journey

It started with a [thread](https://discord.com/channels/139677590393716737/959132842787487814) in the Factorio Discord on 31 March in preperation for r/place to start. However, nothing happened initially, except showing what Factorio did at the previous event. It was only after a brief discussion in our own Alt-F4 Discord server that the first pixel was placed at `{271,555}` by *stringweasel*. This was then forwarded to the main Discord, and it all started! The reference image was simply the picture of what was used in 2017, but soon *ivanjermakov* stepped up became our dedicated blueprint designer by creating the first blueprint seen below:

The canvas was still empty when the initial spot was chosen, but of course, there were always threats for a community to draw over us. The first such threat was the only real other art in the vicinity, the Belgium flag coming up from the South. So peace treaties were sent by (??). It was in this time that the next blueprints were being created to include belts. However, there was a problem with getting the last `O` in Factorio to be a _gear_, because misguided troops were trying to create a normal `O`. This led to some very [strange looking](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959132842787487814/959481710414815232/unknown.png) hoops. It was only after some time that the gear was redesigned and successfully drawn. As soon as the basic idea for the gear was visible (and many DMs sent) the troops finished and defended the gear. Work began on the Northen belt. It started fairly sparked controversy: should the belt have alternating grey-black pixels (similar to 2017) at the bottom or a solid grey line? However, the bigger issue was again that misguided Factorians removed any attempt to bring in the line below the arrows. It was only much later that the belt finally became vertically symmetrical - well after the decision to do a solid-grey line because it's easier.

The time of the great belt-controversy was luckily also the time of new friends. Our Northern belt was on it's way to cover the merry green little boat named Benchy - [r/3Dprinting/](r/3Dprinting/)'s infamous mascot. A user named SevenAndAHalf came to ask for peace, because they had to move their beloved Benchy once already. It was excitely decided that we will become friends with them, and have Benchy riding on our belt! However, again, it took some time to convince the isolated troops that the belt should go _behind_ the green boat. Regardless, good relations were established with r/3Dprinting, and many r/Factorio pixels were placed in aid of Chile destroying Benchy's roof. Benchy's bottom even became part of our official blueprint, and SevenAndAHalf became a honourable ally!

Soon Benchy was on the belt, and our belt was making it's way around the bottom of our logo. By this time there was three gears ("Factoriooo"?) and it was decided that two of these gears should be replaced by circuit. Yet again, the unamed reddit troops were veciously defendending the gears, making it impossible to draw *ivanjermakov*'s beautiful circuits over it. Here is were our own *Nano* stepped in and created a Google Sheet, where everybody chose a pixel (or few) they could place at the signal. As one voice he and SpeckledFleebeedoo screamed charge, and we all placed our loaded pixels simultaniously. And suddenly a fresh green circuit materialized. Success! This method was used quite often from that point forward, for inserters, science packs, even nukes.

TODO had to replace two gears with circuits where *Nano* really helped! This method was used a lot...

![There was even a moment when some streamer decided to an unsolicited attack which almost hit us (Image captured by aptly named *mxdanger*)](media/xqc-threat.png) 

What happened then with xQc?

Soon we made more allys with the people around us... I would like to name them. Do we know who were their reps?

## Double or Nothing

At ?? hours the canvas size unexpectedly doubled, the number of colours doubled, and so did the tension. Many communities scrambling for space while trying to determine what to draw after the initial inrush of trolls. Even in our community tensions were high because there were suddenly many excited voices with design ideas and attack plans. After some floudering we ended up securing `{1600,550}`, because as *Stuckey* suggested, this would allow the possibility of connecting an underground belt to our previous location which is at the same y-level! Thus, a plan was put kicked into action. We will secure the area with belts initially, as laid out by *pg*'s blueprints, while we wait for *ivanjermakov* pixelated intepretation of the Factorio gear. Later an improved version was created by *apatton* which used only 5 colours.

?? Picture of the start of the gear ???

As you might know, the area was secured successfully. Allies were made, battles were faught, and pixels were lost, as told later. However, first doubling of the size wasn't the last of the tricks up Reddit's sleeve. No, after ?? hours the canvas doubled in size yet again! And there was so much open space, which for a long time was wild with flags and amongus. Luckily, this move was anticipated by the Factorio community, and we had a plan! The [talented](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bumble-bots) Discord moderator, *Maxreader*, pre-emptively drew up plans for a locomotive and wagons. Aliances were was also made with other communities, who would "ride" on our wagons, and help us defend the train. (Who's idea?). Even though were quicker in our movements this time around in choosing and securing location around `{500, 1200}` (again recommended by *Stuckey*), but so were other communities. Were quickly ran out of room and were tucked in tightly - next to quite salacious neighbour - with only room for one wagon occupied by our friends from Mindustry.

We built a locomotive, and it was beautiful! ,,,, Later the Aztec Sun Stone on the Mexican flag began to grow, and there was no way to stop it. It vert 


## The War of the Nut

Here is told the story of the War of the Nut. Not battle, but war, because it was indeed multiple battles around the the Factorio Gear on the second canvas expansion. Our gear, or as our enemies mistakenly knew it as: The Nut.

As mentioned earlier the area was originally secured using belts. This was a good strategy because space was very quickly being clamed by other communities. The improved gear logo was also well liked by the community, and construction started soon after the space was secure. However, construction was only about half-way before the first attack - The Void. It already heavily damaged our neighbour - *#100Devs*. Luckily, we sent spies into The Void's Discord, who discreetly relayed the information to us, so we knew their plan. This is where good allys and deep friendships were created, because as a combined effort between Pikmin, Danidev, #100Devs and even Norway, we were able to fight of The Void! They seem to have accepted defeat, and rather redirected their attacks in a Northern direction. With the help of our new friends, we defended our belts, and soon our Gear was completed.

People around us seemed to really enjoy the gear, because soon our neighbour Romania's ambassador *Ironic_Onion* contacted us. They proposed that we should expand our belts over their flag, but only if we matched their colors with their flag. And so another aliance started with Romania! Construction on our new belts were well underway when a new foe approached. Ecuador. And country with almost 18.6 million people, and they were approaching fast, while our troops started their defending calls. The problem was that the people weren't online - meaning they weren't on a single united Discord server. And on the [r/Ecuador](r/Ecuador) subreddit removed all posts related to r/place. The chances of peace talks looked dismal. So dismal in fact, that our official Ambassador *Mr_George* started a long search to get in touch with the Ecuadorians, even joining six of their Discords. However, negotiations with Ecuador were too difficult to establish. The Discords were aggreing on peace and to ally with us, but it did not stop the Ecuadorian hivemind... then....


// I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS SECTION SOUND COOL LIKE A BATTLE

Mr_George built an aliance with Romania, etc.

DNA attacked our right stronghold from below. The Romanian flag agreed to the DNA being drawn on it, but nobody expected the DNA to reach through our belts. There were numerous times when Ecuador our ground, as we became the 

There was a battle between equador and ??? in the vacinity, which seemed to distract them?

Equador did multiple attacks, and we fought back valiantly. The most they took was the bottom half of our belt?

Then a Polish streamer (who?) came and decimated the entire area.

## The Finality of the Anti-Void

In the last moments came the Anti-Void. Nobody expected it..... 


the r/place Risk of Rain wants to give a MASSIVE thank you to the r/place Factorio community for helping us out tremendously as our allies! We really couldn't have done it without you!
-Jaco (Server owner of Official Risk of Rain r/place discord server link provided below)

The Factorio community performed valiantly during the r/place insident. There were many foes around that threatened our well-established area. Trolls, rainbows, hordes of amungus, and even a deady void. But the community stood strong, and importantly built strong alliances with our neighbours by incorporating them into our master blueprint. This allowed us to withstand the test of time, and thus have our monument carved into the halls of time, never to be forgotten. Or at least, until the next r/place or amungos inevitably take over.
