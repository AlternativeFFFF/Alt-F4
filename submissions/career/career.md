## Factorio and STEM

The key parts of Factorio and other [logistics, base building, sandbox, puzzle, problem-solving, real-time strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/9z8x5m/does_factorio_merit_the_creation_of_a_new/) games are:
 * Exploration and investigation
 * Optimisation with limitations
 * Understanding and engaging with complexity
 * Creative Design
 * Biter slaughter
 * Mathmatical analysis of ratios and production

To say these line up nicely with STE(A)M ideals would be an understanment in my opinion. Factorio has a cycle of understanding the problem, breaking it down into managable chunks, designing and testing the solution then using this knowledge in future to improve. This is about as STEM as it gets in my book.

### My story with Factorio

The first game I properly played as a *young buck* was Minecraft. Yes, I know, I know, I am very young. After a while in Vanilla Minecraft, I grew bored with the lack of clear goals and limited item range. I was craving more complexity, and a wider range of possibilities. **ENTER MODS**. Modded Minecraft then took over my life. My pack of choice for a good year or two was [Sky Factory 2](https://atlauncher.com/pack/skyfactory), I dipped into other packs here and there, but Sky Factory had the power to hold my attention. Even now I go back and fire up Minecraft 1.7.10 every year or so and have another run through the pack. For anyone who hasn't played a Sky Factory modpack, it essentially involves a traditional Minecraft skyblock with mods which allow you extract resources (such as ores or seeds) from dirt, gravel, sand etc. Most importantly though, this process is automatable.

The idea that I could make a thing that does my job for me was amazing. Anyone who's played Factorio will of course recognize this idea as the key goal in the game - **Automate *EVERYTHING***. After spending far, far too much time in Sky Factory, I expanded my horizons to other games but found the types of games my friends we're into (FPSes primarily), just weren't my cup of tea. Out in the distance haze, Factorio beckoned me, and I of course bought the game, excited at the possibilities it provided me. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't all sunshine and roses in my journey into the depths of Factorio. As is not uncommon, I gleefully enter the game, made and automated the red and green packs then burned out. Looking back, I suspect there was some Complexity Bias going on here, which again is very common in Factorio if you aren't prepared to break down problems and understand their individual components. The game sat by the wayside, I tried other games and left poor Factorio out in the cold, not a friend in the world.

Several months later, my cousin came to visit and saw I had Factorio - he was excited to play it so we decided that together we would give it a go. After some sketchy library sharing (yay Steam offline mode), we spent a weekend of bliss together, figuring out how the game worked and progressing past the ever challenging blue science packs. *Side note: This is a really great example of Piracy for good since that weekend of Factorio caused my cousin to go home and buy the game himself so we could keep playing together, something that might not have happened if not for our dodgy dealings.* This push past the percieved complexity forever ruined me, it caused the crippling Cracktorio addiction that many of us share, meaning I never could put this beast back down.

So... why am I telling you this? *Fantastic question, really glad you asked. Very well asked question I might add.* For me its pretty clear than playing modded Minecraft and Factorio pushed forward my critical thinking and mathmatical skills and diverted me down the STEM path of goodness. Now, I'm studying Robotic Engineering and though Factorio isn't the only thing that pushed me down this path, it definitely help guide me to where I am now.

### The computer science angle

I'm not alone in the experience of Factorio guiding my choices elsewhere in life. So many people I've talked to, including our very own *Therenas - ~~LORD GOD~~ Editor-in-chief of Alt-F4*, have starting playing Factorio, experimented with mods then been forced into learning to program so they can fufill their desire to create their own mods. I would *blindly, and with no evidence* suggest there are a not insignificant number of people who learned to program because of Factorio and other moddable games. Even just playing around with combinators and learning the basic of computer logic provides a new skill for many people, maybe pushing them slightly closer to the ever loved STEM fields.

### Correlation vs Causation

In writing this piece,  I made a lovely little [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/n8gpes/factorio_and_stem_careers/) on the r/Factorio subreddit, asking people about their relationship with Factorio and STEM, and how it has inspired/changed their education and careers. As always with these kinds of things, I got some of what I wanted, and some interesting new perspectives I hadn't really considered.

> At 32 years old I started my STEM career before factorio was created, and way before I started playing the game. There is definitely a correlation between the kind of mind that goes into STEM and the kind of mind required to play and enjoy this game.

> I think it's correlation. People with STEM aspirations tend to enjoy/be attracted more to games like factorio. The mind set is typically already there, or else they don't like it and stop playing it.

These two comments raise very eloquently the idea that Factorio is an *engineer/scientist/mathmetican*'s dream come true. An open playground with clearly defined rules to explore, design and create interesting stuff with no upfront material cost, all whilst sat in our comfy desk chairs. It's an opportunity for people to explore their creativity, and stretch and expand that *oh so special* muscle in the brain resonsible for critical thinking and design.
