## Nauvis Archives: Ancient Megabase <author>stringweasel</author>

Since the beginning players have been pushing the limits of Factorio. Seeing how absolutely massive they can build their factories before the game starts grind to a halt and succumb to a slow UPS death. And over the years these limits has been broken time and time again, each time reaching a new record. Currently the record seems to be [u/swolar](https://www.reddit.com/user/swolar/)'s [60UPS 20kspm base](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/comments/gels6c/20k_spm_hybrid_megabase/). Three years ago the largest base was roughly half of swolar's size, which was likely [u/AccidentalChef](https://www.reddit.com/user/AccidentalChef/)'s which ran at [10 rpm](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5osdaa/my_first_gigafactory_10_rockets_per_minute/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). And a *month* before that the record was likely AccidentalChef's [3rpm base](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5jntq4/train_based_3_rocket_per_minute_factory/), where he even predicted a 10rpm base would [not be playable](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5jntq4/train_based_3_rocket_per_minute_factory/dbihbkr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (You will notice the metric being `rpm`, or `rocket-per-minute`, since it was before the [Research Revolution](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-159)â„¢). But how did the biggest megabase look **5 years ago** - before we had rocket launches? How does it compare to modern megabases? And what did it take to build such monstrosities?

### The 1 Rocket Defence Per Minute Factory

Back pre-0.12, in 2015, bases was not measured in `science-per-minute`, or in `rocket-per-minute`. Rather, it was measured in `rocket-defense-per-minute`. At the time [rocket defense](https://wiki.factorio.com/Rocket_defense) was the final end-game item for which the idea was to `"protect the landing of the rescue fleet"` - even though there was no rescueing fleet. But, bases actually  rarely approached `1 rocket-defence-per-minute`.

### The Designer: DaveMcW

Before the base is explored,  The player who designed this is not any old Factorio player. Chances are that you have taken part in his trends, marvelled at his interesting hacks, or use the blueprint string system he designed.

The transport belts interrupt the spitter attack animation, making them do zero damage. The laser turrets focus fire the biters, making them do zero damage. It never needs repairs.
