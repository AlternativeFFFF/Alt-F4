## Nauvis Archives: Ancient Megabase <author>stringweasel</author>

Since the beginning players have been pushing the limits of Factorio. Seeing how absolutely massive they can build their factories before the game starts grind to a halt and succumb to a slow UPS death. And over the years these limits has been broken time and time again, each time reaching a new record. Currently the record seems to be [u/swolar](https://www.reddit.com/user/swolar/)'s [60UPS 20kspm base](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/comments/gels6c/20k_spm_hybrid_megabase/). Three years ago the largest base was roughly half of swolar's size, which was likely [u/AccidentalChef](https://www.reddit.com/user/AccidentalChef/)'s which ran at [10 rpm](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5osdaa/my_first_gigafactory_10_rockets_per_minute/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). And a *month* before that the record was likely AccidentalChef's [3rpm base](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5jntq4/train_based_3_rocket_per_minute_factory/), where he even predicted a 10rpm base would [not be playable](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5jntq4/train_based_3_rocket_per_minute_factory/dbihbkr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (You will notice the metric being `rpm`, or `rocket-per-minute`, since it was before the [Research Revolution](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-159)™). But how did the biggest megabase look **5 years ago** - before we had rocket launches? How does it compare to modern megabases? And what did it take to build such monstrosities?

### The 1 Rocket Defence Per Minute Factory

Back pre-0.12, in 2015, bases was not measured in `science-per-minute`, or in `rocket-per-minute`. Rather, it was measured in `rocket-defense-per-minute`. At the time [rocket defense](https://wiki.factorio.com/Rocket_defense) was the final end-game item for which the idea was to `"protect the landing of the rescue fleet"` - even though there was no rescueing fleet. But, bases actually never really even approached `1 rocket-defence-per-minute`. It wasn’t easy building a base at that scale at the time, the reasons of which I will discuss soon. It was widely assumed that nobody is crazy enough to even attempt reaching 1 rpm. But then on the day of 29 June 2015 the legendary [DaveMcW](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaveMcW/) showed the world that it is indeed possible with this [gigantic base](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/).

This base shook the community, as clearly expressed by the top [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csmijcz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/TheWrongCat. It suprised some of Factorio's biggest builders, including [u/Zistau](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csmk0he?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [u/rootnegative](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csmw6iv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [u/Xterminator5](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csn0pk8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Even Wube's lead developer, [u/kovarex](https://www.reddit.com/user/kovarex/), [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csnfvg8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on how hard it would be to optimise Factorio run this base at 60 FPS/UPS (spoiler: *it still doesn't*). DaveMcW truly shattered the limits of what was thought possible in Factorio.

To a few it came as no suprise since DaveMcW has always been on the cutting edge of Factorio. He was the original creator of the [Blueprint String](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=6742) which was later added into vanilla. He built the first [large scale colour display](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5dxi3a/factorio_sandstorm/), famously showcasing [Darude Sandstrom](https://youtu.be/mgfwwqwxdxY). He created a mod called [Recursive Blueprints](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/recursive-blueprints) to automate blueprint placing, and then built a fully functioning factory using the mod that's *only* [9x14 tiles big](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/6j48q7/9x14_micro_factory_recursive_blueprints/). He was even the one who found the [origin](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/526zwk/i_found_the_source_of_the_alien_artifact/) of the original [Alient Artefact](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-6/#alien-artifacts-a-primitive-technology) sprite. Needless to say, if any player was able to pull this of, it was DaveMcW.

The transport belts interrupt the spitter attack animation, making them do zero damage. The laser turrets focus fire the biters, making them do zero damage. It never needs repairs.
