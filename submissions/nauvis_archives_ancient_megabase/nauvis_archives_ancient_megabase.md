Since the beginning players have been pusing the limits of Factorio. To see how absolutely massive they can build their factories before the game starts grind to a halt and succumb to a slow UPS death. And over the years these limits has been broken time and time again, each time reaching a new record. Currently the record seems to be Swolar's [20kspm base](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/comments/gels6c/20k_spm_hybrid_megabase/). Three years ago the largest base was likely Accidental chef which ran at 3kspm. To break these limits strategies had to change. But what did it look like 5 years ago, before we even had Space Science?
