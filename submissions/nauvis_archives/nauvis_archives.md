## Nauvis Archives: How Far We’ve Come <author>stringweasel</author>

Factorio was not always the well-oiled machine that players know and love today for its simple, but deep, gameplay mechanics and relentless overtones of lifelong addiction. It took years of hard work, dedication, and communication by the developers to deliver this gem to the world.

I hope to document some of the journey the game has taken over these years in order to show newer players the dedication that’s required to create a game like this, and to tickle the nostalgia bone of some of the veterans among us.

There are various things that I would love to revisit, like ancient priority splitters, short underneathies, belt corner compression loss, and many other topics. I could talk about it for hours. But for this first post, there is one thing that has always stood out during my six years of playing Factorio.

### Alien Artifacts: A Primitive Technology
I believe one thing which people remember with fondness, but would never want back, are the [alien artifacts](https://wiki.factorio.com/Alien_artifact). The veterans-of-old called them purple orbs or purple goop. Remembering these artifacts at first makes you smile with nostalgia, but then you close your eyes — happy that you don’t have to experience them ever again.

Back before the [research revolution](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-159)™ of 0.15 there were only four science packs; Red, green, and blue science packs were close to how we know them today, but the purple ones were called [alien science packs](https://wiki.factorio.com/Alien_science_pack). These infamous science packs were produced from alien artifacts, which were obtained by destroying biter nests.

Interestingly, in even older versions of the game, these artifacts looked slightly different — you might recognise them from the developers’ flairs on [/r/factorio](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio). Some said these artifacts looked familiar. Some said they were taken from [a different universe](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/526zwk/i_found_the_source_of_the_alien_artifact/). Some said they looked sort of... alive.

Anyway, this meant everyone had big production lines for the first three science packs, and then this (usually lonely) assembler slowly turning alien remains into purple science packs. Most people enjoy killing the natives of Nauvis in order to build yet another iron outpost, which meant *typically* there was enough goop lying around. However, when you urgently needed to unlock the next technology but were busy enjoying struggling with oil refineries or whatever, then you tended to run out of purple science. At that point you quickly realised that there was no way to automate its production, meaning every time you wanted to advance the research tree, you needed to go outside and create mayhem.

Day-in, day-out, you hunted down biters, destroying their homes and taking their remains, all for the sake of progress. Throwing poison and destroyer capsules wildly with each wave of enemies charging at you (while smartly leaving the laser defence at home). It became an endless and unforgiving battle, but you had to push on because the factory must grow. You began to feel sorry for the biters. Co-existence was not an option. The only way to progress was to actively destroy everything they love and cherish.
