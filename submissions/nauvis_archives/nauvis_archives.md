## Nauvis Archives: How Far We've Come <author>stringweasel</author>

Factorio was not always the well-oiled machine that players love today for it's complexity in game-play, simplicity in use, and life-stealling addictiveness. No. It took years of hard work, dedication, and communication of the developers to deliver this gem to the world. But - most importantly - is all the lessions that was learned from when they started in 2012. 

My hope is to - as a community - document some of the journey that this game has taken over these years. To show new players the dedication that's required to create a game like this. And to tickle the nostalgia-bone in some of the veterans among us.

### Alien Artefacts: An Primitive Technology

I belive one thing that people remember with fondness, but would never want back, is the alien artefacts. Or as it's officially known: [Alien Artifacts](https://wiki.factorio.com/Alien_artifact). It's the type of thing that makes you smile with nostalgia, but happy that you don't have to experience it again.

Back before the Research Revolution of 0.15 there was only four science packs. The Red, Green and Blue Science were close to what we know them as today, but Purple Science was called [Alien Science](https://wiki.factorio.com/Alien_science_pack). This devious science was made from alien artefacts, which was obtained by destroying biter spawners.

However, in older versions of the game the artefact looked slightly different. You might recognise it as the developers' tags on reddit. Some said it looked familiar. Some said it was taken from a different [universe](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/526zwk/i_found_the_source_of_the_alien_artifact/). Some said it looked... alive.

Anyway, this means everyone had big production lines for the three the science packs, and then this (usually lonely) assembler slowly turning alien remains into science. 

Most people enjoy killing the natives of Nauvis to build another yet another iron outpost, which means *typically* there was goop lying around. But, when you really needed to unlock the next technology and were enjoying struggling with oil refiniries, then you ran out of purple science. Then you quickly realized that there is no way to automate it! This means everytime you want to advance the research tree, you need to go outside and create mayhem.

Day-in-and-day-out you hunted down biters, destorying their homes and taking their remains, for the sake of progress. Throwing poison and destroyer capsules wildly, and leaving the laser defense at home. It become an endless battle. You began to feel sorry for the biters. Co-existing was not an option. The only way to make progress is to actively destry everything they love. 

Then [r/theLV2](https://www.reddit.com/user/theLV2/) graced us with [art](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/674kkq/a_tribute_to_the_purple_orb_fanart/) that spoke to our hearts. A thought so harsh and sweet that it still keeps me awake at night.
