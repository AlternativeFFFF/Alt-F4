## Mod Spotlight: [Yuoki Industries](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Yuoki) <author>ChurchOrganist</author>

The Yuoki Industries mod suite is similar to the other big overhaul mods (such as Krastorio 2, Bob’s, Angel’s, or Pyanodon’s) in that it creates new game content, but is unique in that it doesn’t replace vanilla content, rather adding to it, often with alternative recipes.

It is also unique in that progress is not dictated by the tech tree, but rather by having access to the materials required to make an item. To do this, it adds new materials and technologies to the game, including new ways of generating power, agriculture, and a multitude of additional rail vehicle options.

Yuoki Industries recently went through a rough patch due to the author YuokiTani (notable for supplying graphics to a wide range of Factorio mods) no longer having time to play Factorio, and thus being unable to test any new additions to the mod.

To remedy this, YuokiTani established a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yuoki-Industries) for his mods which has enabled coders in the community to step up and offer their help. Consequently, the main Yuoki mod has recently undergone a facelift to bring it more in line with the current state of the base game.

The mod has been improved in the following ways:

1. There are now settings:
    * Disable vanilla productivity module behaviour.
    * Adjust player reach and inventory size.
    * Start the game with tier 1 Yuoki power armour, a shield, battery, generator, roboport, and 50 construction robots.
2. Mining times have been shortened to coincide with vanilla.
3. Logistic buffer chests have been added.
4. Storage chests now have logistic filters.
5. All Yuoki radars have map visualisations.
6. Yuoki mining drills have circuit connections.

There have also been a number of improvements to [Yuoki Industries Engines](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/YuokiTani/yi_engines), but there is still work to do on bringing it up to the same standard as the main mod. In due course, the other mods in the Yuoki Industries suite will be overhauled and improved where necessary.

For those of you interested in seeing Yuoki Industries in action: I will be streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/churchorganist) at 10:00 UTC+1 on Mondays and Saturdays beginning October 3rd, starting a new Yuoki base from scratch. I will be pleased to answer any questions about the mods that I’m able to answer.

Happy building!
