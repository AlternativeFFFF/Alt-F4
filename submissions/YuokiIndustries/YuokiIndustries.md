# Yuoki Industries Mods Spotlight
![] (https://imgur.com/a/4ESk79M)
The Yuoki Industries mod suite is like the other big overhaul mods such as Krastorio 2, Bob’s, Angels, or Pyanodon in that it creates new game content, but is unique in that it doesn’t replace vanilla content, but rather adds to it; often with alternative recipes.

It is also unique in that progress is not dictated by the tech tree, but rather by having access to the materials required to make an item. To do this it adds new materials and technologies to the game, including new ways of generating power, agriculture, and a multitude of additional rail vehicle options.

Yuoki Industries recently went through a bad patch due to the author, YuokiTani, notable for supplying graphics to a wide range of Factorio mods, no longer having time to play Factorio, and thus test any new additions to the mod.

The Yuoki community has stepped up, however, and with the establishment by YuokiTani of a GitHub repository for the mods, has enabled coders in the community to offer support. Consequently the main Yuoki mod has recently undergone a facelift to bring it more into line with the current state of the Vanilla game.

The mod has now had the following improvements:-



1. There are now settings:
    *   To enable/disable vanilla productivity module behaviour (default enabled)
    *   Adjust player reach (default Vanilla setting)
    *   Set Player Inventory size (default Vanilla)
    *   Start the game with Tier1 Yuoki Power Armour, 1 shield, 1 battery, 1 generator, a roboport and 50 construction robots.
2. Mining times have been shortened to coincide with Vanilla
3. Logistic buffer chests have been added
4. Storage chests now have logistic filters
5. All Yuoki radars have map visualisations
6. Yuoki Mining drills have circuit connections

There have been a number of improvements to Yuoki Industries Engines (Addon), but there is still work to do on bringing it up to the same standard the main mod now has. In due course the other mods in the Yuoki Industries suite will be overhauled and improved where necessary.

For those of you interested in seeing Yuoki Industries in action I will be streaming on Twitch at 10:00 UTC+1 on Mondays and Saturdays beginning October 3rd, and starting a new Yuoki base from scratch. I will be pleased to answer any questions about the mods that I’m able to answer.
