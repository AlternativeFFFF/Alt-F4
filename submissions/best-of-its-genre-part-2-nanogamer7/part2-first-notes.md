## Title

Lead question: What differentiates automation games from games with automation?

[Last time] Origin of automation, what is automation?

[Now] What is the genre, how have other games adapted?

### Examples of automation

According to steamDB, "most popular" (most followers) games with the tag "automation" are in that order: Astroneer, Facotrio, Satisfactory, Dyson (..., Craftopia, Planet Nomads, Dota Underlords, etc.)

Satisfactory

- some FFF (idk the number, but I saved it for later)
- Clearly inspired by Factorio
- Other aspects, fits in other genres
- Less strategy, less theory about logistics
- Main goal is still to make the factory that makes more stuff for you
  - Obviously still hand crafting, but slower (as in factorio)

{Dyson sphere project if I'd have played it}

Minecraft mods / mod packs after Factorio / inspired by it

- The Factorio mod, but that doesn't count
- Still a survival game
- You explore, you find resources - automation to make stuff while you are gone, but you still explore
- SkyFactory (reference to Conor?), no exploring [To check: SkyFactory 1 (before|after) Factorio]

Astroneer

- Similar to Minecraft mods - adds automation to a survival game
  - not the core idea - rather an addition later on

More survival games

- Like Astroneer, automation in addition to the survival aspect
  - Again, **not the core concept!**

Non-survival games with automation?

Management games?

More Automation games?

### Factorio, Automation, and Survival

Did Factorio add automation to every 2nd survival game?

Concepts of automation across games

- Mostly more Satisfactory and nuanced similarities, e.g. "Science", Tiers (...of transportation, machines, etc.)

[Recap/More detail]:

- What does it mean for Astroneer to have automation?
- Difference to e.g. ARK: you have machines, put something in there, then in there, etc. (you want a product so you do every step of it) **vs.** Astroneer: you have machines, put something in there, inserters then put it there and here and you can explore more (you want a product, and it's made for you) **vs.** Factorio: you have machines, and they make products continuously, rather than however many you need when you tell it {I need to make this sound smarter}

### Conclusion
