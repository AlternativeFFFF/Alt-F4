## The Best of Its Genre – Influence of a Game

A few months ago in [issue #34](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-34/) I tried to find the origins of Factorio, and with it the origins of the automation genre. But since Wube pioneered this genre in 2013, many games adapted and embraced it, like [Satisfactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/) and [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/), but also games more focused on survival like Astroneer, later versions of Minecraft and more recent mods for it. In this article I want to explore what became of the automation genre, and how automation games are differentiated to survival games with some automation.

### Part 1: The Big Three

When you ask someone to name some automation games other than Factorio, the most common response you'll get are Satisfactory and Dyson Sphere Program. Together with Factorio, they are even regarded as the (un-)holy trinity of automation by some players.[^1] But what makes these games stand out from the rest (apart from their rating, the highest among all games on steam with the 'automation' tag[^2])?

{screenshot of ratings?}

- All three games are set in an open world, and you, the player, are an entity in it building the factory. Neither of them is required for automation, as for example [shapez.io](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapezio/) perfectly works without a playable character, and there a plenty of games like [Opus Magnum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/) that are in a level-based puzzle environment.
- Your progression is mainly through a skill/technology tree (even if it isn't actually tree shaped in Satisfactory)—special technology to send through a space elevator in Satisfactory, research matrixes in DSP, and finally, the bottle-shaped science packs in Factorio. Most open world (survival) games feature some sort of skill tree, but acquiring new points rarely features a connection to the game world, while your world, your factory is to some degree completely build around the tech tree; your progression in the skill tree isn't based on your progress in the rest of the game, it **is** your progress in the game.

- And finally, all three games games mainly challenge your knowledge and understanding of logistics. While the spaghetti of some bases might suggest otherwise, space isn't actually an issue (or at least not a big one) due to the open world, but getting massive amounts of raw resources from a mining outpost back to your main base, and maybe even moving production to said outpost to export the most dense/compact products (see [Alt-F4 #7](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-7/#megabase-thinking-lonewolf)). This challenge might be a direct result of the open world nature of the games, but especially long range trucks and trains provide a much needed "unknow" variable to the defined ratios—unknown as in not as obvious as items per second on belts—as well as a challenge, a bottle neck scaling inversely with production.

Apart from the similarities in gameplay, the three games also feature a remarkably similar scenario of being dropped on an empty planet with only some basic resources to start with; although I don't think there are (m)any other themes that would explain why you need to make **everything** from scratch, at least none that wouldn't sound artificial.

### Part 2: Automation in Other Games

Speaking of scenario, there is a forth game with this scenario, with a similar theme of multiple, small planets, with a great rating, with the 'automation' tag on steam, and it is arguably even more popular than the other three games: [ASTRONEER](https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/). Why didn't I mention it before? It certainly has a similar scenario, you can automate large parts of your production...

Let's get back to the previous article, what does automation even mean, how can it be defined:

{quote: 'One could loosely define automation as "making stuff that makes stuff"' author: Nano/Myself}

Keep in mind this is only one possible definition of the genre, but it already runs into some problems. Let's take Nanocarbon Alloy as an example, a late game material needed for almost all high tier machines: To automatically produce it we first need resource depots for Iron, Graphite, Ammonium, and Titanium. This by itself doesn't seem too unreasonable, but it is already our first issue: Astroneers only automatic transportation is by auto arms, its equivalent of inserters. However most resources don't spawn right next to each other, so to even get all the solid resources together you'd need extensive amounts of inserter chains. But the much bigger problem are two gasses, Helium and Nitrogen, which both aren't available on the same planet as Iron and Titanium, and the only interplanetary transport is by a manned rocket. So already we need to make stuff by hand, with no way to automate.

{Note to editor: I think the explanation of Nanocarbon Alloy is a bit unnecessary long, I'd maybe shorten it if it doesn't fit the flow}

Most of the reason automation in ASTRONEER isn't possible to an extend like in real automation games, is because it isn't an actual automation game. The auto arm—and with it some other tools to automate—only got added in version `1.13`,[^3] a full year after the original `1.0`release of a pure survival game.

Many (survival) games feature some sort of automation today: Minecraft's hopper, added in version `1.5`in early 2013[^4], is the first example of simple machine to machine transfer I could find, and might have influenced Factorio's inserter too, but ASTRONEER's auto arm, the auto miner, the conveyors in TerraTech, ~~the belts in some Overcooked levels~~ are all reminiscent of similar Factorio mechanics, and all got released after Factorio first got popular. And then there are mods: Basically every tech Minecraft mod since `1.6.4` (although those might also be influenced by the earlier Minecraft mods) features automation.

Still, none of the games above have automation at their core. You might spend way to long building complex machineries, intricate factories, and tightly packed rovers, but none of them progress your gameplay directly. You still need to explore, discover, and fight your way further towards your final goal. There can however be made an argument for SkyFactory, one of my favourite Minecraft mod packs, which circumvents the problem of exploration by having nothing to explore.

### Part 3: Simulation, Idle, and Puzzle Games

Most games so far are in some way part an open-world survival or sandbox game, however there is a subgenre of automation most of us have come on contact with and regularly play: Designing the assembly line itself. There are numerous automation puzzlers, which exclusively focus on that part of automation, for example Opus Magnum, as already mentioned, or [factorio](https://stargardengames.itch.io/factori), a game scoring one of the first places in the recent [GMTK 2021 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021/results/top-marks). But fit the definition—you make stuff that makes stuff—chemicals in one, and letters in the other. Does [Emergency Protocol](https://haruzter.itch.io/emergency-protocol) (there area lot of puzzle games in game jams btw) fit the definition? You make a pattern that *makes* a path? In its core it sounds like automation—you tell a little robot what to do (program it), and it repeats your commands—but that also sounds similar to idle games—set something up, and it does a job for you while you are away.

Speaking of which idle games aren't really considered automation games, and neither are management games or simulation games, as I discussed in [my last article](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-34/#automation-defined). But then again, there is the meme of automating Factorio itself, which some players [have successfully done](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-39/#josefs-organically-self-expanding-factory-josef-drogiwan-cannobi). On a more serious note, some players really do play Factorio as a management game—or does "I need more circuits, lets slap down the circuit blueprint in this free city block" sound like automation to you?

### Conclusion

To summarise, automation still isn't a type of game like 'puzzler', but it can definitely be the defining genre. However it is still possible to add automation to game, without having it at its core. That being said, my last article left automation a bit more open, and I hope a could give a more SATISFACTORY definition and conclusion this time by FACTORIOing in more recent games.

{Note to translators: please just skip this pun if it doesn't work in your language, the sentence should work even without it}
