## Complexity Corner: Speakers <author>The Kool</author>

Welcome back to Complexity Corner, where we look over the less used or more complex mechanics of the game to give an introduction to those unfamiliar with them. In this article, we'll ask three questions: 'What is it?', 'What results can it give?', and 'Where should it be used?'

### What is it?

The [Programmable Speaker](https://wiki.factorio.com/Programmable_speaker) is a 'building' that takes up only one tile. When connected to a circuit, it can make sounds that you'll hear in-game based on the signals on that circuit. You can adjust the volume, pick a specific sound for it to play, tell it to be audible no matter how far away you are, and even show a custom alert on the map. The speaker is unlocked with the Circuits technology, which is so early in the tech tree that it could be your first green tech.

### What results can it give?

It produces sounds! Okay, that one was kind of a gimme. While speakers are best known for [the musical contraptions](https://miditorio.com/) people build with them, they serve some practical uses as well. If you hook up a speaker to your factory and set global playback and an alert icon, you can design custom alerts for just about anything. You can (and should!) give it a custom icon and title because you'll absolutely forget what the blaring klaxon is for. This is an easy way to broadcast an alarm over your entire factory and can help you catch warning signs of trouble before they become true problems.

### Where should it be used?

Have you ever strained your power supply and accidentally caused your coal miners to slow down, sending you into a brownout spiral as your boilers gasp for fuel? Try placing a speaker next to the coal belt leading to your boilers and hooking it to the belt with a wire. A full belt holds 8 items, so if you set the speaker to trigger on less than 8 coal, you'll get an alarm if any gaps show up in your coal belt. Set this alarm to global playback and give it a name like "Check on your coal mining!" and you'll get the notice no matter where you are or what you're distracted with.

A completely different type of alarm is a train crossing alarm. Hook a speaker up to a rail signal on your track where you like to cross, plus one more signal in each direction (make sure you get the signals on both sides of the track). Tell it to sound a local alarm if any of the signals are yellow (number of yellow signals > 0). Next time you head towards that rail and there's a train coming, you'll get a nice loud siren telling you to wait a moment before crossing!

Like many other things in Factorio, the uses for the speaker are boundless, both in practicality and creativity. Builds range from the super simple shown above, to the super complex midi players and beyond. I hope this inspires you to come up with some of your own and saves you a few headaches. Until next time, I'll see you on the factory floor... and watch your step!
