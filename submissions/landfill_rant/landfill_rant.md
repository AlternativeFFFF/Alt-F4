## A small rant about landfill <author>pocarski</author>

"Your mistakes have no cost but time", says [u/talrich](https://www.reddit.com/user/talrich)'s quote on the [Factorio subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/). And yes, for almost anything you do in this game, you can undo your actions at any point. That is true for everything you can build, except for one thing: landfill. While placing any other entity or tile in the wrong spot costs you only a second of your time, doing that with landfill will not only make you irreversibly lose the quite expensive landfill, but it also leaves you with an awkward landmass that you didn't want and now can't remove. In this article, I will be presenting the issues irreversible landfill creates, and hopefully the benefits of making it removable will become clear to you, dear reader.

### Outdated mechanic

While not being able to dig up landfill was perfectly justified in the pre-0.17 days, back when landfill was literally just the default `grass-1` tile, in 0.17.10 it was separated into its own distinct tile. Along with allowing landfill to be placed by bots and included in blueprints in 0.17.0, this set up the perfect condition for also removing landfill or at least allowing us to do something to it that can't be done to other tiles.

### Expensive mistake

Each piece of landfill costs an entire 20 stone to make, meaning an entire 800k stone patch is only enough to landfill a 200 by 200 square, which is really not that much considering the sizes of builds people make. A long time ago I made a nuclear reactor design that required a whopping *2700 landfill*, and it only made 480 MW! There isn't much talking needed to describe the pain of placing a blueprint comparable to that 1 tile off at first and having somewhere around 50 landfill (that is literally **1000 stone**!) just sitting there unused and not available to you anymore.

### Messes with offshore pump placement

Now since I mentioned nuclear power, time to talk about what allows most big reactor builds to work: internal offshore pumps. They are offshore pumps included in the blueprint itself that rely on the shape of the landfill island to pump water properly. It only takes you to accidentally drag the blueprint while placing, and you've already ruined the entire landfill base. In the best case, you can just move some pumps and it will still work, and in the worst case you filled in a critical hole and now the entire platform is unusable and has to just sit there empty and be a massive eyesore.

Related to that is the fact that you can landfill around an existing offshore pump, but that pump can't be placed back if ever removed. What this means is that if you ever have to place anything directly next to an offshore pump, you *have* to place landfill there first, since offshore pumps can only be placed if surrounded by water. This means you have to commit to that pump being there, and if you ever remove it, you'll have to do some intense head scratching to figure out how to route the water from a different pump.

### Conclusion

- Irreversible landfill is an outdated mechanic that can and should be revised
- Misplacing landfill is extremely expensive, since it can't be recycled once used
- Misplacing a blueprint that contains landfill can often ruin entire projects

Landfill is the only placeable object in the game that requires full commitment from the player. As someone suffering from commitment issues, I avoid placing landfill in freeplay at all costs, and personally, I don't think this is how any game mechanic should be treated. Letting us dig up landfill will absolutely improve the game (and in the rare case the player removes landfill under themself and dies it's gonna be their own fault). Of course, there is always the "if you want removable landfill, just install some mods" argument, but I feel like that goes against Wube's philosophy of making a polished game.
