# Join us tomorrow!

Last week I got contacted by Ki Tan from (Big Community Games)[https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Factorio-MMO/] about some exciting news: Monthly MMO events starting the first Saturday of every month. Yes, you read it correctly, this Saturday right away!

If you are familiar with the multiplayer of Factorio you may have seen these hosts already.
Besides the release party (mentioned in Altf4-3)[https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-3/#dont-break-the-new-toys-please-t-a-r] these hosts are responsible for events like Welcome to Factorio" and the unforgettable (Spiffing Brit)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hgvIhMkgKU] run.

The multiplayer has come a long way since our favorite (local newspaper)[https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-58] presented its release in the era of Factorio 0.11.
Since then both players and developers wondered what the maximum amount of players possible to play on a server. Wube wanted bug reports and the players wanted a fun session. As the performance of the game increased bug reports became rarer. It simply required more and more people to yield "interesting" test results. The habit of announcing multiplayer sessions was born.   

With the release of Factorio 1.0, the goal of large multiplayer servers shifted form testing to enjoying, which introduces room for mods to spice up the gameplay. And that is exactly what is going to happen tomorrow.

Krastorio 2 is the selected mod for this (returning) event. As mentioned in [fff338](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-338) Krastorio 2 is a complete overhaul mod focussed on maintaining on the vanilla feel of Factorio. This way the event will be interesting to anyone who knows the basics of Factorio even if you don't have any experience in modded/multiplayer Factorio. 

If you are a Factorio streamer and want to participate in the event, you can, it's open to all. Streamers will be listed on the website closer to the event under a live menu on the front page and also the BCG discord. The server will be left running after the event for up to 2 weeks.
