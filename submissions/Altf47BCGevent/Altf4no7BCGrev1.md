## Join the BCG MMO event tomorrow! <author>T-A-R</author>

Last week, I got contacted by Ki Tan from [Big Community Games](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Factorio-MMO) about some exciting news: Monthly MMO events starting the first Saturday of every month. Yes, you read that correctly, it'll start right away, this very Saturday!

If you are familiar with the Factorio multiplayer, you may be familiar with these hosts already. Besides the release party mentioned in [Alt-F4 #3](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-3/#dont-break-the-new-toys-please-t-a-r), they are responsible for events like "Welcome to Factorio" and the unforgettable [Spiffing Brit run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hgvIhMkgKU).

The multiplayer has come a long way since our favorite [local newspaper](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-58) first presented it in the era of Factorio 0.11. Since then, both players and developers wondered what the maximum amount of players a single server could support is. Wube wanted bug reports and the players wanted a fun session. As the performance of the game increased, bug reports became rarer. It simply required more and more people to yield "interesting" test results. The habit of announcing multiplayer sessions was born.

With the release of Factorio 1.0, the goal of large multiplayer servers shifted from testing the game to enjoying it, which introduced room for mods to spice up the gameplay. And that is exactly what is going to happen tomorrow.

Krastorio 2 has been selected as the main mod for this (returning) event. As mentioned in [FFF #338](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-338), Krastorio 2 is a complete overhaul mod focussed on maintaining on the vanilla feel of Factorio. This way, the event will be interesting to anyone who knows the basics of Factorio even if you don't have any experience playing modded or multiplayer Factorio.

If you are a Factorio streamer and want to participate in the event, you can of course; it's open to all. Streamers will be listed on the website closer to the time of the event, in a live menu on the front page and also on the BCG Discord. The server will be left running after the event for up to 2 weeks.
