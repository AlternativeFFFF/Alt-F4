## Join the BCG MMO event tomorrow! <author>T-A-R</author>

Last week I was contacted by Ki Tan from [Big Community Games](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Factorio-MMO) about some exciting news: Monthly MMO events starting the first Saturday of every month. Yes, you read that correctly: it’ll start right away; this very Saturday!

If you are familiar with Factorio multiplayer, you may be familiar with these hosts already. Besides the release party “Welcome to Factorio” mentioned in [Alt-F4 issue 3](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-3/#dont-break-the-new-toys-please-t-a-r), they are responsible for various other large events including the unforgettable [Spiffing Brit run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hgvIhMkgKU).

Multiplayer has come a long way since our favourite [local newspaper](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-58) first presented it in the era of Factorio 0.11. Since then, both players and developers have wondered about the maximum number of players a single server could support. Wube wanted bug reports and the players wanted a fun session. As the performance of the game increased, bug reports became rarer. It simply required more and more people to yield “interesting” test results. The habit of announcing multiplayer sessions was born.

With the release of Factorio 1.0, the goal of large multiplayer servers shifted from testing the game to enjoying it, which introduced room for mods to spice up the gameplay. And that is exactly what is going to happen tomorrow.

Krastorio 2 has been selected as the main mod for this (returning) event. As mentioned in [FFF-338](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-338), Krastorio 2 is a complete overhaul mod focussed on maintaining the vanilla feel of Factorio. This way, the event will be interesting to anyone who knows the basics of Factorio even if you don’t have any experience playing modded or multiplayer Factorio.

If you are a Factorio streamer and want to participate in the event, you can of course; it’s open to all. Streamers will be listed on the website closer to the time of the event, in a live menu on the front page and also on the BCG Discord. The server will be left running after the event for up to 2 weeks.

For more info like the full mods list, check out the [website](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Factorio-MMO) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/N8G5nBn). We hope to see as many of you as possible tomorrow!
