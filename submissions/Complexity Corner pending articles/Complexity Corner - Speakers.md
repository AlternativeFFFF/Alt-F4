### Complexity Corner: Speakers <author>The Kool</author>

Welcome back to Complexity Corner, where we look over the less used or more complex mechanics of the game to give an introduction to the unfamiliar.  In this article, we'll ask three questions: 'What is it?', 'What results can it give?', and 'Where should it be used?'

What is it?

The [Programmable Speaker](https://wiki.factorio.com/Programmable_speaker) is a 'building' that takes up only one tile.  When connected to a circuit, it can make sounds that you'll hear in game based on the signals on that circuit.  You can adjust the volume, pick a specific sound for it to play, tell it to be audible no matter how far away you are, and even show a custom alert on the map.  The speaker is unlocked with the Circuits technology, which is so early in the tech tree that it could be your first green tech.

What results can it give?

Sounds!  Okay, that one was kind of a gimme.  While speakers are best known for [the musical contraptions](https://miditorio.com/) people build with them, they hold a practical use as well.  If you hook a speaker up to your factory and set global playback and an alert icon, you can design custom alerts for just about anything.  You even get to give it a custom icon and title, because you'll absolutely forget what the blaring klaxon is for.  This can help you catch problems before they become problems, like blackout spirals in your power grid.

Where should it be used?

Speaking of blackout spirals, try placing a speaker next to the coal belt leading to your boilers and hooking it to the belt with a wire.  A full belt holds 8 items, so if you set the speaker to trigger on less than 8 coal, you'll get an alarm if any gaps show up in your coal belt.  Set this alarm to global playback and giving it a name like "Check on your coal mining!" and you'll get the reminder even if you're halfway across the factory.

A completely different type of alarm is a train crossing alarm.  Hook a speaker up to a rail signal on your track where you like to cross, plus one more signal in each direction (make sure you get the signals on both sides of the track).  Tell it to sound a local alarm if any of the signals are yellow.  Next time you head towards that rail and there's a train coming, you'll get a nice loud siren telling you to wait a moment before crossing!

There's plenty more uses for speakers, as practical as they are creative.  I hope this inspires you to come up with some of your own and prevents future blackouts.  Until next time, I'll see you on the factory floor...  and watch your step!
