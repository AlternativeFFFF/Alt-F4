### Talks with Legends: Zisteau <author>stringweasel</author>

There are many famous names that come to mind when thinking about Factorio. Great players that created amazing content over the years and introduced many people to our beloved game. These are names that helped shaped Factorio and it's community as we know it today. One of these names, that will likely never be forgotten, is [Zisteau](https://www.youtube.com/user/Zisteau). I reached out to him to ask him a few questions about his time in Factorio, and he said `"yeah sure"`.

Who is Zisteau? He is better known as Tyler in the less-automatable real world and has been a full-time content creator since 2011 with now almost 350 000 subscribers on YouTube. When he is online he goes by his gamertag Zisteau, which is a [combination](http://mindcrack.altervista.org/wiki/Zisteau) of the words `jacuzzi` and `Jacques Cousteau`, but he also goes by Zed or Z. He has played many games over the years but received his largest following from his active involvement on the Minecraft [MindCrack](http://mindcrack.altervista.org/wiki/Mindcrack) servers, where was feared for his huge pranks. His content is usually high-effort edited YouTube videos and large scale megaprojects, all while maintaining a relaxed sense of humour and always having fun. It's not uncommon for him to glance over tens of hours of work in his videos, only spend the rest of the video on a meme.

In November 2014 he released his [first Factorio video](https://youtu.be/aGnifxzUVcg) on YouTube after playing it for 70 hours offline. Asking where he first heard about Factorio he mentioned: `"I saw my friend `[Sevadus](http://www.twitch.tv/sevadus)` streaming Factorio on Twitch some time in 2014. I bought the game shortly after that"`. Since then he played Factorio periodically, focussing on various different projects and modpacks. He has spent much more time in Factorio than most players and his playtime in `"total is nearing 2,700 hours"`. As most of you know, even after many hundreds of hours of Factorio play you can still feel like a total noob. Asking Zisteau when he finally started to feel like a professional Factorio player he mentioned that it `"was after 2,000 hours played"`, but more on when that was later.

Over the years he has made great Factorio content, always sticking to high-effort videos condencing many hours of grinding gameplay into short and exciting videos. The series that hooked me first was [Factorio Meiosis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaFzYF6jJyUIJYXYpCE4UIr3) (which is now featured in the unofficial Factorio [Hall of Fame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame)). Meiosis means [cell division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis), which he also referenced in the video description `"It simulates the ADP to ATP synthase cycle in the form of hordes of little bastards that like the taste of your fear"`. Another one of his big series was a beautiful and extensive [Sea Block](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaGW9Z7ZmBkaD4gvVjnkyXQA) base - his first time trying Angels and Bobs - which is definitely worth checking out. [Sea Block](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlock) is arguably one of the toughest mods to play, but Zisteau still kept his focus on aesthetics and content, all while building a very thorough and capable factory. However, you likely recognise his name from a different series - his favourite series. When I asked him when he started feeling like a professional Factorio player he said: `"I think I became a complete Factorio player after finishing my 5k science per minute `[Recursion Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaFcabUTWbxjYppVK9c4FA8a)` base"`. In this magnificant base, spanning over two series and two years, he condensed an entire 5kSPM factory into a single [Factorissimo](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2) building. All production was done inside the main building, which contained more Factorissimo buildings. All smelting, refining, and processing - even nuclear power, was done inside. He only allowed himself to import raw resources. And still, Zisteau did not forget about aesthetics,  which included the memorable [Rainbow Roads](https://youtu.be/-WhDtg-6_b4?t=96) which has inspired many other beautiful builds - like [The Beehive by Valkhiya](https://youtu.be/hWOZiN1kaAc). This Recursion Recursion base was truley a work of art, and it's likely the biggest factory contained in a single Factorissimo building ever.

[slidy picture things showing outside/inside of Recursion Recursion]

Zisteau also spent [a lot of time](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaE8bz7-qtoLfRcG7QlUwT-L) in another factory building game, that may-or-may-not have been inspired by Factorio, called Satisfactory. Here he found a brand new method to [build large scale structures in a matter of minutes](https://youtu.be/T6F0IQqNQmU) that not many people know about, which aided him in his massive projects. Curious, I asked him which is his favourite, Satisfactory or Factorio. He answered: `"I don't know if I can pick a favorite with Satisfactory being so early in development. I do not think Satisfactory will have the same longevity as Factorio if the developers don't add ways to scale production and streamline tedious building"`. However, a there is a massive difference between how a game plays, and how visually pleasing it is. Sometimes beautiful looking games are lacking in gameplay, and sometimes less visual-driven games can result in hundreds of hours of fun, like the legendary [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/). Therefore, I asked Zisteau which game is his favourite in terms of building and the way you lay out automation, Factorio of Satisfactory? He answered: `"Aside from both having conveyor belts they are very different games. Satisfactory is overall a simpler game but is in 3D, so there is a 3D-puzzle spatial manipulation element that Factorio doesn't have. It is definitely more cinematic when you can have massive skyscraper factories sitting amongst canyons and cliffs, but I don't think it will ever have the same sense of scale of activity that Factorio can achieve"`.

So far it seems like Zisteau really enjoyed his time in Factorio. As any game though, it's easy to have annoyances with the game, even when you can gladly sink thousands of hours into it. Asking Zisteau what's his biggest annoyance with Factorio he answered: `"I don't have any major annoyance with Factorio. The only thing I can think of is I would like a greater variety in aliens"`. Zisteau has spent many gruelling hours expanding his borders through [deathworld](https://youtu.be/Z2C1pOMY5og?t=96) biter territory, so it seems he is ready for a bigger challenge. This idea was also brought up when asked what he would like the anounced upcoming [Factorio expansion](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-365) to include, to which he replied: `"More alien variety. Bio-tech. Spaceships. Subterranean areas"`. Then, for a quick break from factory games, I asked him a serious question. Who is the real, true, bald guy? Him - being Zisteau? Or [SethEverman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI&lc=Ugyb0OkJoZemhn5BD194AaABAg&ab_channel=BillieEilishVEVO) - the [man](https://www.youtube.com/user/SethEverman/), the meme, the [legend](https://youtu.be/xCY9B8POq3A)? Not missing he beat he replied: `"I've just checked worldwide statistics, and it appears that there are at least 2 bald humans on planet Earth."`

Zisteau has been part of Factorio almost since the start. He occationally scrolls through [r/Factorio](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/), and has released extensive [blueprints](https://www.factorio.school/view/-MIUdn2Kl5GPETxJ_E2m) into the community (that sometimes [gets lost](https://www.reddit.com/r/FactorioBlueprints/comments/kbklla/looking_for_the_original_creator_this_is_not_mine/)). He [was even there](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/3biwcf/one_minute_rocket_defense/csmk0he?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when DaveMcW made his iconic [One Rocket Defence Per Minute](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13/) base five years ago. However, one of my favourite ways that Zisteau helped shape our community is that he actually inspired one of the Factorio developers, Klonan, to [start playing](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-300) the game in the first place. Asking Zisteau what he thought about this he said: `"I was not aware of that. That is pretty cool."` This is likely why the video description of the [series](https://youtu.be/aGnifxzUVcg) that inspired Klonan is now featured as a quote on the official [Factorio website](https://www.factorio.com/).

Factorio is a super duper awesome game where we use conveyor belts to shoot aliens.

I hope this gave you a small glimpse into a great YouTuber's time in Factorio. He has been part of our community since the early days, and will hopefully remain so in the furure! I'm sure there also many more of you that can contribute picking up Factorio to seeing Zisteau play. And who knowns, he might even be lurking in the reddit comment section reading your comments. And as Zisteau often says: `"See you next time, and bah-buy!"`
