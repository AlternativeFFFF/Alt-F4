Finally, the reason why we're all here: Factorio has just been released for real. It's been a tremendous success story, of the kind that only comes around every so often. I want to commend everyone involved, Wube first and foremost of course, for this incredible achievement. This game is a tour-de-force in optimization and design that will stand the test of time for many decades to come. Bravo!
