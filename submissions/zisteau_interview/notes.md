Factorio is a super duper awesome game where we use conveyor belts to shoot aliens.

1. DONE Where and when did you hear of Factorio first? 

I saw my friend Sevadus streaming Factorio on Twitch some time in 2014. I bought the game shortly after that.

2. DONE How many hours have you logged on steam with Factorio? And if you had to guess the total hours? (I assume you were playing before the steam version).

Steam shows I have 2,466 hours played. I put about two hundred hours into the game before it was released on Steam so my total is nearing 2,700 hours.

3. DONE After how many of those hours did you start to feel like a professional Factorio player, like you knew what you were doing. 

I think I became a complete Factorio player after finishing my 5k science per minute Recursion Recursion base. At that point I had experimented in all aspects of the game. It was after 2,000 hours played.

4. Do you watch other Factorio streams or LetsPlays? And if so who? This can be someone now or in the past.

I don't often watch other people play the same games I play.


5. What's your biggest annoyance with Factorio? Ideally, in the latest version you played, but you could also mention an older annoyance. What about the aspect you enjoy the most?

I don't have any major annoyance with Factorio. The only thing I can think of is I would like a greater variety in aliens.

6. Which Factorio player, now or in the past, do you look up - or respect - the most, and why?

No one in particular.

7. What is your favourite memory/moment/base in Factorio? Could be anything related to Factorio, just something you remember fondly.

My favorite base is my Recursion Recursion base. To my knowledge it is the only megabase squeezed into a single factorissimo factory.

8. What has been your favourite Factorio mod pack to play with? And why?

 The only modpack I've played extensively is SeaBlock, which was fun.

9. DONE Wube is likely to start working on an expansion pack soon. What would you like to see an expansion pack?

More alien variety. Bio-tech. Spaceships. Subterranean areas.


10. DONE. What do you think about the fact that you inspired one of the Factorio Developers at Wube (Klonan) to start playing Factorio before he joined Wube? (Reference, look for Klonan)

I was not aware of that. That is pretty cool.

11. DONE You've played a lot of Satisfactory too. This game is very similar to Factorio but has some key differences. If you had to choose your favourite between Satisfactory and Factorio in terms of aesthetics, which one is your favourite? And why?

I don't know if I can pick a favorite with Satisfactory being so early in development. I do not think Satisfactory will have the same longevity as Factorio if the developers don't add ways to scale production and streamline tedious building.

12. DONE Both Factorio and Satisfactory has very different ways of building factories and automating logistics. Based purely on the layout and the way you set up automation, which one is your favourite, Satisfactory or Factorio?

Aside from both having conveyor belts they are very different games. Satisfactory is overall a simpler game but is in 3d, so there is a 3d-puzzle spatial manipulation element that Factorio doesn't have. It is definitely more cinematic when you can have massive skyscraper factories sitting amongst canyons and cliffs, but I don't think it will ever have the same sense of scale of activity that Factorio can achieve.

13. Who is the real bald guy? You, or SethEverman? (Reference)

I've just checked worldwide statistics, and it appears that there are at least 2 bald humans on planet Earth.

14. What do you do when you're not making videos? Do you have a guilty pleasure video game? Or some other hobby?

I don't really have hobbies anymore. I'm either streaming or making videos.
