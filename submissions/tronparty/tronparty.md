### Don't break the new toys please <author>T-A-R</author>

The first Alt-F4 was a exiciting surprise when my stubborn mind went to Factorio.com last friday, knowing there would't be a fresh #361 waiting for me. I decided i wanted to support this initiative, and the best way to show support of this fresh community based Friday Facts was to act fast. #2 was already around the corner: A field report about one of the fresh 1.0 "not-a-bug-bugreports:

The second best thing to the Official release party in Prague is ofcourse a good old Multiplayer server. Multiple release parties sprouted on the Factorio Lobby hosting fresh maps, many engineers from all over the world joined their friday to layout some ambitious main busses. The Big Community Games (https://discord.gg/FWQWKKA) server was able to catch the most momentum and peaked at 201 players. Which was a good as you need a decent base to chew away all the required science packs to meet the best feature of 1.0.

Blessed with dense ore patches and a clever map note (describing team colors and their duties), the server started as a hyperactive ant collective programmed for making smelter collumns. The map message around spawn did a wonderful good job in early organisation of the ever growing group of engineers. Early on a isolated factory was raised next to the science factory to keep all the redshirts fed with gear and ammo. This gave both the troopers and the builders a steady supply to expand and grow the factory.
And so it did. It took 11 hours to produce a rocket. Among with around 20 Spidertrons, a shipload of equipment and armours and a ton of ammo and explosives.
By this time Italy, Bilka bay, and lake Twinsen were discovered according to the map markers left by seasonned engineers.

As soon as the Spidertrons came in production it became clear that these legs are feel very unusual but forceful at the same time. The intriguing sight of simpy stepping over lakes and machines slowly turned the exploration tour into a test of the capabilities of this new _toy_/tool. Belts soon turned out as a point of interest for many of the spiders that were running around the map.

The shared excitement led the admins to add their contribution to the party, to trow this new Spidertron to the ultimate test and turn this release party in a Spidertron Rave. A colorful dance floor was quickly terraformed to stretch some legs.

The combination of counterdirective belts and gaps in the map drove the brand new spidertron legs in awkward split stretching the legs infinitely. High time to update the devs about these findings with a fresh 1.0 bugreport (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=182&t=87982). It ended as one of the most viewed bugreports, However, already a duplicate not-a-bug.

V453000 had already responded on one of the first 1.0 bugreports (30 minutes after release) to point out restriction would't be desirable, and that our spiders were actualy performing just fine (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=87915). . So the fact that we "could" does not eliminate the question if we "should"...

Well, the playtrough was an absolute blast, and along we truely felt in love with the Spidertron. He's one of us now.
