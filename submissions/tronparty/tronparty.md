## Don't break the new toys please <author>T-A-R</author>

The [first Alt-F4](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-1/) was an exiciting surprise when my stubborn mind went to factorio.com on Friday, knowing there wouldn't be a fresh post #361 waiting for me. I decided I wanted to support this initiative, and the best way to show support for this fresh community was to act fast. So, here's a field report about one of the fresh 1.0 "not-a-bug"-bugreports:

The second best thing after an official release party in Prague would be a good old multiplayer server. Multiple release parties sprouted in the Factorio lobby on Friday, all hosting fresh maps with many engineers from all over the world joining in to lay down some ambitious main busses. The [Big Community Games Discord](https://discord.gg/FWQWKKA) was able to catch the most momentum and peaked at 201 players, which was good as you need quite a decent base to chew away at all the science packs that are required to get to the best feature of 1.0 (Hint: It's spidertron!).

Blessed with dense ore patches and a clever map note (describing team colors and their duties), the server started as a hyperactive ant collective with an instinct for making smelter columns. The map message around the spawn point did a wonderful job at organizing the ever-growing group of engineers. Early on, an isolated factory was raised next to the science factory to keep all the Redshirts fed with gear and ammo. This gave both the troopers and the builders a steady supply to expand and grow the factory.

And grow it did. It took 11 hours to produce a rocket, alongside around 20 spidertrons, a shipload of equipment and armour and a ton of ammo and explosives. By that time, Bilka bay, Italy, and lake Twinsen were christened according to the map markers left by seasoned engineers.

As soon as the spidertrons came into production, it became clear that these legs feel very unusual, but powerful at the same time. The intriguing sight of simply stepping over lakes and machines slowly turned the exploration tour into a test of capabilities for our new toy/tool. Belts soon turned out to be a point of interest for many of the spiders that were running around the map. The shared excitement led the admins to add their own contribution to the party and made spidertron face the ultimate test: Turn this release party into a spidertron rave. A colorful dance floor was quickly terraformed so the spiders could stretch their legs:

The combination of counterdirective belts and gaps in the map drove the brand new spidertron legs to split awkwardly, stretching their legs infinitely. High time to update the devs about these findings with a [fresh 1.0 bugreport](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=182&t=87982). It ended as one of the most viewed bugreports, but was quickly marked as duplicate: not-a-bug. Developer V453000 had already responded on [one of the first 1.0 bug reports](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=87915) (30 minutes after release) to point out that restricting their movement wouldn't be desirable, and that our spiders were actualy performing just fine. But, the fact that we "could" does not eliminate the question of whether we "should" ...

In the end, the playtrough was an absolute blast, and we truly fell in love with the spidertron. He's one of us now.
