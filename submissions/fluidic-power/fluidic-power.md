### The [Fluidic Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FluidicPower) Experiment <author>stringweasel</author>

Ever since my education in Electronic Engineering I've seen the flow of electricity in everywhere I look, especially. For example the backward-travelling wave of cars (read *electrons*) inching forward in traffic is an the flow of electricity. Even more interresting is how close the flow of electricity is to the flow of fluids. When I flush the toilet and it creates a whirlpool I see an inductor being charged up through a capacitor. When I suddenly close a tap and I hear the water hammering in the pipes I see a inductor's voltage spike that's used for [Boost Converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_converter). Wouldn't it be cool to have this behaviour of electricty in Factorio?

#### The History

As you know vanilla Factorio's electricity is perfect. Your electrical grid can transmit infite power over infinite distances indefinitely. It's almost like they strung cryogenically cooled [super-conductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) to the small and cheap wooden power poles. This works very well for the purpose and constraints of the game and fits most players perfectly. However, since the start there were always a few players looking for more of a challange who wondered if electricity could be made more realistic.

There are a few mods that have attempted this, all in differnt ways. One of the first ones was probably [Flow Network](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Simdezimon/flownetwork).
