## Mod Spotlight: [No Belts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/no-belts) <author>oof2win2</author>

*No Belts* is a type of Factorio mod that does something not a lot of mods dare to: it removes a core game mechanic. As you might have guessed from the title, the mod removes your ability to place belts, which is generally one of the first things you place down when you start automating things. Instead, you can place logistic robots much earlier in the game, basically from the point where you manufacture your first green circuit.

The grind at the start may feel a bit harder, but it has a reward: everything ~~must~~ can be bot-based. Mining, production, everything. The concept of a "main bus" can be thrown out, since nothing like that is possible (unless you get train wagons and inserters). Furthermore, you **will** need to re-design a large number of your layouts so they can still be used, as not even robots can place belts. This means that you get to enjoy redesigning nearly everything that you want to use, which might come in handy sometime later if you design them well!

Above, you can see a low-density structure production facility. This is an example of a blueprint that has been converted from using belts to using robots. In this case, it was very easy, as I just used a forest of beacons. You can however create any design you like! The blueprints are available [here](https://media.alt-f4.blog/ALTF4/29/blueprint.txt), but the bot-based factory isn't as productive as it could be - it has a 1k low-density structure deficit due to some issues that I am unable to identify, as I'm not very good with blueprints and factory design.

You may wonder about performance. That is a very valid and understandable question, with robots being considered UPS killers by some. I have thought of this, so I experimented. I gave the Alt-F4 team the save, and they gave their results back, so below is a table containing the results. Do note that 'looking at bots' here means looking at 100k bots in one place, which is something you wouldn't encounter in your average playthrough.

I wish you, the person who might want to try the mod out, the best of luck! This mod forces you to rethink your traditional Factorio playstyle so should hopefully offer a new challenge to anyone who tries it. If you happen to create something amazing (as the community just always does), reach out to me (@oof2win2#3149) on Discord, preferably through the [Alt-F4 Discord](https://discord.gg/ceKebbY). You might even get featured on my mod page!
