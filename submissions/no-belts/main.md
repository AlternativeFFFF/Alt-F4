### Mod Spotlight: [No Belts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/no-belts) <author>oof2win2</author>

*No Belts* is a type of Factorio mod that doesn't show up very often on the mod portal: it removes a core game mechanic. As you might have guessed from the title, the mod removes your ability to place belts, which is generally one of the first things you place down when you start automating things. Instead, you can place logistic robots much earlier in the game, from the point where you manufacture your first green circuit.

The grind in the start may feel a bit harder, but it has a reward: everything ~~must~~ can be bot-based. Mining, production, everything. The concept of a "main bus" can be thrown out, since nothing like that is possible (unless you get train wagons and inserters). Furthermore, you **will** need to re-design a large number of your designs so they can still be placeable, as not even robots can place belts. This means that you get to enjoy re-designing things that you will be using, which might come in handy sometime later if you design them well!

Above, you can see a low-density structure production facility. This is an example of a blueprint that has been converted from using belts to using robots. In this case, it was very easy, as I just used a beacon forest. You can however create any design you like! The blueprints are available [here](blueprints.txt), but the bot-based factory isn't as productive as it can be - it has a 1k low-density structure deficit due to some issues that I am unable to identify (as I'm not very good with blueprints and factory design).

You may also ask about performance. That is a very valid question and understandable with robots being considered as UPS killers. I have thought of this, so I experimented. I gave the Alt-F4 team the save, and they gave their results back, so below is a table. Remember, looking at bots means looking at 100k bots in one place, which is something you wouldn't encounter in your average playthrough.

I wish you, who might want to try the mod out, best of luck! This mod forces you to rethink your traditional Factorio playstyle so should hopefully offer a new challenge to anyone who tries it. If you happen to create something amazing (as the community just won't stop doing), reach out to me (@oof2win2
