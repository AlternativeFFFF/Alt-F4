## I love Factorio because it has no Fluff <author>stringweasel</author>

I love Factorio because it has no fluff. Every aspect is thoroughly investigated, refined, and questioned. Every item, game mechanic, GUI element, and sound. “Is this truly part of our vision” and "yes, but can it be better”. This means there are no stragglers. No weird outdated mechanic that you need to follow. Everything has a well-defined purpose towards one common goal: automation.

And it’s not too much. For example, there's no flashing lights or happy sounds when a rocket launches (although that rumbling sound still gives me goosebumps). You might even miss it if you’re too far away. But it's still satisfying because you know what it took to launch that rocket. You know you placed every inserter, every assembler, and know the path that that iron ore followed to become a satellite.

*That* is why I will always keep coming back to this game.
