## MangledPorkGaming, AKA Bentham
Like many others, I first came to Factorio from watching other people play it on YouTube. I began all the way back around when update 0.10 dropped – June 2014. The Factorio content creators I watched during this period boasted the names [Arumba](https://www.youtube.com/user/arumba07), [Steejo](https://www.youtube.com/user/RotNSteejo), [Aavak](https://www.youtube.com/user/Aavak)... and [MangledPorkGaming](https://www.youtube.com/c/MangledPork/featured).

Who is MangledPorkGaming, and why is his name such a mouthful? In our interview, [he stated](link to interview audio clip) that he wanted to use the name Bentham, but the issue was that it is a common name used by a town in England, some famous people and so on. So, he split the name down the “th” ending up with “Bent Ham”, which lead to Mangled Pork.

Bentham started off his YouTube channel with his down-to-earth and relatively funny [“Let’s Lag in [game]” series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y_o2r1Hhk8&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZJVUFaBhRQgl1r3nACxj24D). He played FTL, KSP, and quite a few other random assortments of games. One day in early 2014, a frantic scramble led to him finding something “easy” to play for that day’s upload (as the day’s previous recording of another game [didn’t quite go to plan](audio clip)), he discovered what he titled, [“the Factorio demo… I’m sorry”](https://youtu.be/honPGJNoDI4?t=70). He had heard of Factorio before - he was introduced to it by Aavak - but just hadn't played it yet. 

Like the rest of us, he became hooked and thus marked the beginning of his Factorio adventures. What made his singleplayer series interesting, is that instead of talking whilst playing, he recorded footage, then later in editing sped it up by x4 and put commentary on top of that. This method leads to a unique perspective where he can laugh or react to his own actions along with the audience, whilst explaining what he was doing, but not having to wait very long, due to the speed up, to explain why he was doing something. This led to a fine balance between those short, condensed, & high-effort videos and those long, stretched out, relaxing & slow gameplay styles. What [lead Bentham to this method](audio clip) was the fact that Sips from Yogscast did a Factorio Let's Play *can anyone find link to this? must've been at least 7 years ago*, but his audience was saying "it's boring, it's so boring!" because the game at the start was just that slow.

Over the course of 2014, Bentham began a few different Factorio series. In August 2014, he began his popular and most favourite [Factorio Railworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw9zgzrF2DY&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZI69s1psHkAdeH2_uNmP9rg&index=1) series and the [Factorio No Crafting Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTszEGCARW4&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZKIrTTzJ5etReO2iFeo_WIp) series. Each video in the Railworld series attracted tens of thousands of views which grew his channel from a few hundred subscribers to many thousands. 

For some reason, I always had it in my mind that Bentham was the first person who properly coined the idea of a "main bus", although at the time he called it the "tree method", as the bus was the trunk with production lines on the sides as the branches. [He said in the interview](audio clip) that in the forums, the "main bus" phrase started cropping up, and it took him a while to realise that it was the same thing as his tree method. Of course it's likely that the main bus is just the natural evolution of many Factorio players that wish to leave the spaghetti playstyle. 

If you a long-time Factorio fan, you may have heard of him from his very popular [Factorio Rail Tutorials](https://youtu.be/XSGYSbEPpbM) which provided a much-needed handy guide to understanding and using trains and signals. I remember not getting over that first steep signals learning curve until I watched these videos. He also did a video on initial oil too, as that also used to be difficult to pick up first time.

Later, in 2015, he began my absolute favourite Bentham series, [Living with Biters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83KSIH4dJg8&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZJXS1sQDUzWtvBLn9ZPyUXk). The idea of living amongst biter bases on peaceful mode is still fascinating to me, as it poses multiple challenges you wouldn’t get in any other normal vanilla campaign. This base is so interesting that stringweasel plans to put it into his fantastic [Hall of Fame mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame).

It was around mid-2015 when he reached the monumental mid-point of his journey around the colossal lake, in his Railworld series. Coincidentally, at the same time, the 0.15 update dropped, bringing the Railworld preset. Bentham wondered if maybe the idea was from his Railworld series, so I asked Klonan (he created the preset) about it, who said "I want to keep some mystery in the world", so, we'll leave that thought at that :)*maybe remove this paragraph? seems like a nice thing to attribute to Bentham but then again, Klonan's answer...*

Since 2015, Bentham has played some of my all-time favourite YouTube series with Factorio (obviously), [The Long Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPm-CEp4jYk&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZLpGM2O2VIET2zT_Cu9WaSS), [Cortex Command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZmMlNR_GU&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZKub2IB8ksP7-SZ6j7FLkU8), [Astroneer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt2SCXqh-d0&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZL_FIlc9y9s2JodKExG6_Uc), [Satisfactory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVMNn4VDOVU&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZJfc-WhE42WNaOusForSHeA) and [Dyson Sphere Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElFjOPyrlts&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZLGjohS04LpsagHgRK31iON). Like Zisteau (covered in our [last Nauvian Perspective article](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-30/)), Bentham played Satisfactory extensively, although not in the same playstyle.

Now, busy with real life and being an admin of the tabletop games, roleplaying and D&D channel [Roll4It](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCifkjVaOOT5VxraQpYUwL6A), Bentham's personal channel has gone a bit spotty uploads-wise. Still, he can boast 1.5k hours of Factorio on Steam, and at least double that more from before the game release on Steam. He's recently had some continuation of his [Factslowrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X388d9waOEg&list=PLOx2-nvzE_ZJGpYLwW3vJSAKqVhECOsz-) April Fools series that isn't really a joke anymore... *Not really sure what to say here?*

## Xisumavoid
Whilst researching Bentham's first Factorio series, I came across a lot of comments from [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/c/XisumavoidMC/featured). I thought this was interesting because although I watched his [late 2014 Factorio series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKdAhv_LkLM&list=PL7VmhWGNRxKjVgYaRnIMZz31i1F9rNUBL&index=1), I didn't realise he had played the game all the way back in its very early days [in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-y3rXzVeo&list=PL7VmhWGNRxKjKohJTh9utStd3XdLN0q6h). Xisuma told me that he first heard of Factorio over 8 years ago! He couldn't remember where he stumbled upon it however he remembered being drawn to its visual style, which is a quality that he enjoys from games. I see a lot of similarities in Xisuma and Bentham - they are both down-to-earth and have similar humour (plus are both English!).

In my interview with Bentham, one of the questions I had was if maybe he had first heard of Factorio from Xisuma, which as I've covered earlier was not true. However, Bentham [gave an interesting story](audio clip) as to how he heard of Xisuma, involving the terrible YouTube messenger service and Steejo finding his personal Facebook account. Xisuma responded to this story; *not sure how to lead this on?*

> "Having looked up Bentham I totally remember watching his videos! There were not a lot of people playing the game at the time so the search engine and recommendations would churn up the few people that were."

Back in 2019, Xisuma tried a Factorio series again but hit that same problem that many other Factorio content creators have with the game - that it is too slow, so without having to put loads of effort into the editing, the content does not contain the same high entertainment standard than other games he plays like Minecraft.

> "Minecraft feels endless. This is because your own creativity is what you put into game, you make the experience. Factorio on the other hand has a tech tree, creative direction and path to follow. To step outside of that you need to be really good at math and planning for the advanced mega base concepts which I am not."

The series did end up as a flop and since then he never touched the game again. It did make me a little sad, however, it's only fair since it's his job to create entertaining content and the Factorio series just had no success on his channel.

When I asked if Xisuma might play Factorio again, maybe when the Expansion drops;

> "I am definitely interested in playing it again. A DLC would be a good excuse to get back into it.

*some attempt at a "closing statement" - feels janky though:*
Wether you're a fan of Xisuma, Bentham, or any other creator with a history of Factorio, another part to look forward to the expansion is the content creation.
