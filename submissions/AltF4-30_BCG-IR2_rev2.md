# Full steam ahead!

Big Community Games is happy to announce another Factorio MMO event. A very ore rich piece of Nauvis was scouted. A great opportunity to launch a rocket all together this very Saturday! The theme of this party will be Steam Punk. 
Deadlock989's (Industrial Revolution 2)[https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution] will bring all the steam and smoldering fuel we love, and possibly even a bit more.

Compared to vanilla our toolbox gets expanded with all kind of technologies. New materials and processes will make crafting the rocket a bit more complex in a very enjoyable way. There is a list of small addition mods along with other details on the (event page)[https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/factorio-ir2/]. 
The server will go live in the regular multiplayer lobby on Saturday 18:00 UTC/GMT.
