## Full steam ahead! <author>T-A-R</author>

Big Community Games is happy to announce another Factorio MMO event. A very ore-rich piece of Nauvis has been scouted, bringing us a great opportunity to launch a rocket together this very Saturday! The theme of this party will be Steampunk. Deadlock989's [Industrial Revolution 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution]) will bring all the steam and smouldering fuel we love, and possibly even a bit more.

Compared to vanilla, our toolbox gets expanded with all kinds of technologies. New materials and processes will make crafting the rocket a bit more complex in a very enjoyable way. The [event page](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/factorio-ir2/) has the full modset and further details. The server will go live in the regular multiplayer lobby on Saturday at 18:00 UTC/GMT.
