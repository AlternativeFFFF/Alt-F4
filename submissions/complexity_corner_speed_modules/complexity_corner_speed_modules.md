## Complexity Corner

Welcome back to the Complexity Corner!  This is a series of articles that spotlight various seemingly complex aspects of the game and attempt to shed enough light on them to let even beginner users feel like they can start using them.  To this end, we will ask three questions: "What is it?",  "What results can it give?", and "Where should it be used?"  While these articles are aimed at beginners, even veterans of the game may be beginners on a specific topic, so come along for the ride!  [Last time we were here | Link to first Complexity Corner] I talked about productivity modules, and today I'll be talking about speed modules.  In addition to talking about speed modules by themselves, I will also go over what makes them different from productivity modules and how to decide which you want to use.

### What are speed modules?

Speed modules, like productivity modules, are items that can be placed into a building to modify how the building works.  Unlike productivity modules, they provide a very simple tradeoff: The building uses more power, but works faster.  More on the 'consuming more power' part later.  Speed modules can also be placed in beacons, but I'll cover that in a later article focused on the beacons and their use.

Speed modules make machines work faster.  That means the machines will produce more per minute.  Building more assemblers can get the same result for cheaper, but sometimes that's no longer an option.  Sometimes, the logistics of supporting those extra buildings is too much, or you don't have the room to expand.  Sometimes your base is just too big for your computer and you need to make the game itself run more efficiently.  Sometimes you're trying to fit into a complex build, or trying to change the speed of one building to match a recipe.

### What results can they give?

The speed increase granted by a speed module ranges from +20% to +50%, and these bonuses stack.  This means that filling an Assembler Mk.3 with Speed 3 modules (4x +50%) makes it work 3x as fast as normal.  One of the most common uses I've given my speed modules is to upgrade my existing factory to meet higher demand, such as to feed ammo to hungry gun turrets.  Throw in a few speed modules, get more ammo per second.  In this case, you can drop two Speed 1 modules in every assembler and get 40% more output.  It changes the ratios a little, but not enough to matter in an organically growing base like that of someone still figuring out the game.

Speaking of ratios, carefully selecting which module goes where can make a complex ratio much simpler.  In the Green Circuit build shown above, you can see how the mismatched speeds of the wire and circuit assemblers are perfectly balanced by adding a few speed modules to the wire assembler (it just needs a +50% bonus).  In the image below, you can see how just a handful of speed modules can make a small science build work in sync.

Remember how I said that we'd come back to the 'using more power' part?  Now's a good time to bring that up.  If power or pollution is a concern, you will use less power and produce less pollution by making more assemblers instead of using speed modules (remember, pollution is matched to power usage).  By making your machine work at 120% speed, it uses 150% power!  The tradeoff gets better as you use higher tiers of modules, but it will always take less energy and make less pollution to have more buildings instead of using speed modules.

### Where should they be used?

Last time, the answer was simple.  Want free stuff, spam productivity modules.  Now we have a choice between two different modules, and they both seem similar at first glance.  Both types of module give us 'more', so how do we know which to use where?  Well, here's the thing.  Productivity modules will slow your base down to give free stuff; speed modules will speed your base up.  If you need more items per second, productivity modules will work against you and fill up slots you could be using for speed modules.

Last time I talked about specific places where productivity modules are useful, and that still holds even when considering other modules, so I suggest you go give that a read if you haven't yet.  Speed modules also have certain places where they become especially useful:

* Mining drills: The ore you gain per second is limited by how many mining drills you can place.  Adding speed modules can make that small patch feed a bigger base, but beware of it running out faster.
* Pumpjacks: Once your pumpjack works the oil patch down to its minimum value, load it up with speed modules to get more out of it.  Unlike mining drills, it's not ever going to run out at this point.
* Complex ratios: A few carefully placed speed modules can turn a mess of spaghetti into neat lines.  Consult your favorite calculator and play around with configurations to see what fits!

Before I go, I do need to address something you'll hear.  Some people will tell you that you actually get faster output by using a mix of productivity and speed modules as opposed to only speed modules.  This...  is actualy true, but /only/ if you are using beacons.  We'll go over that when we get to talking about beacons, but first we'll need to address the third module: the efficiency module.  Until then, I'll see you on the factory floor!
