## I love Factorio because of the Community <author>Zirr</author>

When I made the subreddit on a whim almost 8 years ago, after finding a cool-looking game on Indiegogo, I didn’t expect much – certainly not over 200k subscribers. After putting many hundreds of hours into managing it, I can say that it’s been an absolute joy.

Generally, there is a trend of subreddits growing and becoming more hostile as a result, mainly to newcomers, but I don’t feel that way at all with /r/factorio. As a community, it’s taken very well to the growth spurts, the biggest of which being the launch on Steam and Factorio 1.0. I mainly attribute this to factors like being a non-competitive game, with a focus on collaboration and appealing to a mature audience.

Of course, it also helps that the game and developers are absolutely fantastic; I imagine it would be a very different situation otherwise. The community is truly great – this very ALT-F4 is a testament to that. Thanks to everyone who makes the community what it is!
