## I love Factorio because of the community <author>Zirr</author>

When I made the subreddit on a whim almost 8 years ago, after finding a cool-looking game on indiegogo, I didn’t expect much – certainly not over 200k subscribers. After putting hundreds upon hundreds of hours into managing it, it’s been an absolute joy.

Generally, there’s a trend of subreddits growing and becoming more hostile as a result, mainly to newcomers, but I don’t feel that way at all with r/Factorio. As a community, it’s taken very well to the growth spurts (the biggest ones being steam launch and 1.0) and I mainly attribute that to factors like being non-competitive, focus on collaboration and maturity.

Of course, it also helps having an absolutely fantastic game and developers behind the community, I imagine it would be very different if not. The community is truly great – this very ALT-F4 is a testament to that. Thanks to everyone who makes the community what it is!
