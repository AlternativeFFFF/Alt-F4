### Complexity Corner 3 - Efficiency Modules <author>The Kool</author>

This week we're on our third Complexity Corner!  If you haven't been following along, I suggest you go read the first [link to CC1] two [link to CC2], because we'll be rounding out our first set of articles by talking about the last of the three modules, efficiency modules.  As always in these articles, we'll take a look at three questions: "What is it?",  "What results can it give?", and "Where should it be used?"

What are efficiency modules?

Like the other two modules, efficiency modules can be placed into buildings to change how they work.  Like speed modules, efficiency modules can be placed anywhere with a module slot.  Unlike both speed and productivity modules, efficiency modules have one effect and one only, with no drawbacks or side-effects.  Well, one effect that has two benefits; they reduce how much power the building takes to operate, which also reduces the pollution the building produces.

What results can they give?

While they can reduce the strain on a power network that has been pushed to its limit, or save you resources by not having to make anywhere near as many solar panels and accumulators, the main benefit is reduced pollution.  A LOT of reduced pollution.  An efficiency 1 module reduces power and pollution by a staggering 30%!  An important note however is that each machine can only benefit from a max of 80% reduction, so keep that in mind when you're planning for their use.

Many theory-crafters like to assume clean energy for the entire factory.  That is, all the power comes from solar, which has no pollution.  The truth is that for many of us, we spend much of a playthrough relying on steam or nuclear, both of which create pollution (though nuclear does so indirectly through the fuel cell creation).  In fact, many of us never rely completely on solar.  This means that the reduced power usage also means reduced pollution from power generation.

Even if you do generate all your power from solar, efficiency modules will still reduce pollution, because pollution creation is modified by the power usage multiplier.  This means that if your machine is only using 20% power because of efficiency modules, it is also producing only 20% pollution.  For example, an Assembly Machine 2, which normally produces 3 pollution per minute, would only produce 0.6 pollution per minute.

To show how drastic an effect both of these benefits can have on your pollution cloud, I've prepared a simple factory that makes 45 SPM, making power from solid fuel and steam, a setup that is fairly close to an average player's pre-rocket factory.  I ran this factory three times: once with no modules, once with speed 1 modules, and once with efficiency 1 modules.  Take a look at the pollution clouds after 1 hour.

Where should they be used?

Deathworlds, mining outposts, and solar fields.  Other reasons for using efficiency modules exist, and they can benefit any factory, but these are the main three.  Let's go into these in a little more detail.

Deathworlds can be pretty tough, but it's important to remember that if you can keep the nests out of your pollution cloud, you get far fewer and smaller attack waves.  Why go on difficult conquests to clear your cloud when you can just have a smaller cloud?  To gain the best benefit from this, throw efficiency 1 modules into everything as soon as you can.  How soon is that?  In the red/green stage, right after you unlock red circuits!

Mining drills have one of the highest pollution rates of any building in the game, and you make entire fields of them.  This means a single large mining outpost can easily be putting out more pollution than your entire main factory.  Convenienty enough, electric mining drills have 3 module slots, so if you fill them with efficiency 1 modules then your entire outpost only produces 20% of the pollution.  Since these are often outside your defensive line, this means they attract far fewer attacks and are much easier to defend.

As I mentioned earlier, reducing the amount of power needed is a benefit in and of itself. Solar fields can be downright massive, and fairly expensive to make.  If your factory is full of efficiency modules, it can wind up using less than half the power it normally would, which directly translates to a solar field that's half the size.  That means it goes up for half the cost, too!

Because efficiency modules don't have a drawback, they are a great thing to just toss in wherever you aren't using another module.  Nothing but benefits await, the only cost is the materials to make them.  If you don't feel like you need to use productivity or speed modules, go ahead and try these out.  Because you can usually hit the 80% reduction ceiling with tier 1 modules, some of the best uses for higher-tier efficiency modules are actually when combined with other modules... but that's a discussion for another day.  Until then, I'll see you on the factory floor!
