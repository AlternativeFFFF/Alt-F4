### Complexity Corner 3 - Efficiency Modules <author>The Kool</author>

This week we're on our third Complexity Corner!  If you haven't been following along, I suggest you go read the first two articles about [productivity modules](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-12/#complexity-corner-productivity-modules-thekool) and [speed modules], because we'll be continuing the series by talking about the last of the three modules, [efficiency modules | link to wiki].  As always in these articles, we'll take a look at three questions: "What is it?",  "What results can it give?", and "Where should it be used?"  Our goal in this series is to show those of you who are hesitant to begin using these mechanics that it is super easy to dive right in.

What are efficiency modules?

Like the other two modules, efficiency modules can be placed into buildings to change how they operate.  Like speed modules, efficiency modules can be placed in any module slot.  Unlike both speed and productivity modules, efficiency modules have one effect and one only, with no direct drawbacks or side-effects.  Well, one effect that has two benefits; they reduce how much power the building takes to operate, which also reduces the pollution the building produces.

What results can they give?

While they can reduce the strain on a power network that has been pushed to its limit, or save you resources by not having to make anywhere near as many power producers, the main benefit is reduced pollution.  A LOT of reduced pollution.  An efficiency 1 module reduces power and pollution by a staggering 30%!  An important note however is that each machine can only benefit from a max of 80% reduction, so keep that in mind when you're making use of them.

Many theory-crafters like to assume clean energy for the entire factory.  That is, all the power comes from solar, which has no pollution.  The truth is that for many of us, we spend much of a playthrough relying on steam or nuclear, both of which create pollution (though nuclear does so indirectly through the fuel cell creation).  In fact, many of us never rely completely on solar.  This means that the reduced power usage also means reduced pollution from power generation.

Even if you do generate all your power from solar, efficiency modules will still reduce pollution made by the machine itself, because that pollution is modified by the power usage multiplier.  In simpler words, this means that if your machine is only using 20% power because of efficiency modules, it is also producing only 20% pollution.  In this example, an Assembly Machine 2 would only produce 0.6 pollution per minute, down from the normal value of 3 per minute.

To show how drastic an effect efficiency modules can have on your pollution cloud, I've prepared a factory that is roughly representative of an average player's pre-rocket factory, maybe even smaller.  It makes 45 SPM, makes all its power from solid fuel and steam, and uses mid-tier machines (steel furnaces, electric mining drills, Mk2 assemblers).  I ran this factory three times, starting each run with no pollution.  The first run was with no modules, the second run used a mix of productivity and speed 1 modules, and the third run used efficiency 1 modules everywhere.  Take a look at the pollution clouds after 1 hour.

Where should they be used?

Many reasons for using efficiency modules exist, and they can benefit any factory, but the main three use cases are deathworlds, mining outposts, and solar fields.  Let's go into these in a little more detail.

* Deathworlds can be pretty tough, but it's important to remember that if you can keep the nests out of your pollution cloud, you get far fewer and smaller attack waves.  Why go on difficult conquests to clear your cloud when you can just have a smaller cloud?

* Mining drills have one of the highest pollution rates of any machine in the game, so a large mining outpost can easily be putting out more pollution than your entire main factory.  If you fill them with efficiency 1 modules, your entire outpost only produces 20% of the pollution, making it easier to defend.

* Solar fields can be downright massive, and fairly expensive to make.  If your factory is full of efficiency modules, it can wind up using less than half the power, which means a solar field that's less than half the size!

Because efficiency modules don't have a direct drawback, they are a great thing to just toss in wherever you have free slots.  Nothing but benefits await, the only cost is a few red and green circuits.  As with any module, or even solar panels and accumulators, a true full analysis of the costs and benefits should include the material and energy costs to create it in the first place.  While that's well beyond the scope of this series, a few reddit users such as *Antun789* have [taken passes at it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/gp454w/build_cost_and_power_efficiency_math_of_8_and_12/)  Feel free to take a look over their work, and perhaps add your own pages.  I know I plan to add a few!

Finally, because you can usually hit the 80% maximum benefit from just tier 1 modules, many people jump to the conclusion that the higher tier efficiency modules are useless.  That isn't true, because they can be combined with other high-tier modules to offset their drawbacks... but that's a discussion for another day.  Until then, I'll see you on the factory floor!
