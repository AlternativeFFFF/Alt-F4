### Complexity Corner: Beacons <author>The Kool</author>

Welcome back to Complexity Corner!  This week, I'll be taking a slight left on the topic of modules that I've held for the first three articles, and will be going over the beacon, a building completely reliant on modules for its existence.  As before, I will ask three questions about this potentially unfamiliar thing: “What is it?”, “What results can it give?”, and “Where should it be used?”  My goal is to show those of you who haven't used it yet just how easy it is to work with.

What are beacons?

The [Beacon](https://wiki.factorio.com/Beacon) is a building that takes up a space of 3x3 tiles.  It first appears relatively late in your usual playthrough, requiring purple science to research, but the most advanced ingredient is red circuits.  A beacon has two module slots, and will transmit half the effect of those modules across a 9x9 area, reaching anything within 3 tiles of the beacon.  All this is to say, it takes a module and spreads its effect across nearby buildings.

What results can they give?

Most people see beacons as a megabase tool, and it's true, they are very effective at improving UPS (Updates Per Second).  With faster machines, you need fewer of them, and fewer things moving means your computer can handle bigger factories.  Improving UPS is far from they only thing they do, though.

The two best ways to use a beacon are to surround one beacon with buildings, or to surround one building with beacons.  The first case is good for making those expensive tier-3 modules do more work per module (as much as 4 modules worth of work), and the second case is for pushing a building far beyond its normal capacity.  With speed modules in and around an Assembly Machine 3, the speed of the building is twice as fast as it would be without beacons, and 6x as fast as with no modules at all.

A quick note must be given to what beacons cannot do: Beacons cannot contain productivity modules, and beacons will only boost a building that has module slots.  So no, you can't put speed modules in a beacon and expect your steel furnace to work faster.  Your electric furnace, however, would work faster.

Where should they be used?

It usually doesn't make sense to put efficiency modules in beacons, but usually doesn't mean always.  If the energy reduction on affected buildings would offset the energy usage of your beacon, then you get a net energy savings.  While this is unlikely to happen with most buildings, each beacon needs only reach three Assembly Machine 3s to achieve this if you're using Efficiency 3 modules, so it's worth keeping in mind.

Speed modules in beacons are much more common.  If you have something that just NEEDS to run as fast as possible (like exhausted oil pumpjacks), you can surround it with speed-filled beacons.  You can do the same thing in a grid if you have a part of your factory that is getting way too large, such as furnace arrays, in order to get their size way down.  Remember: you don't have to go full megabase to play around with beacons in your base, so give them a try in small corners where you think they'll help!

Finally, I should say that efficiency modules will offset the penalty from speed beacons, so you can mix them together in an array like the one above to significantly reduce the pollution output.  The minimum energy and pollution factor is 20% of the building's original value, not the value after penalties, so your efficiency 3 modules really start to shine here.  If you mix 10 Eff3 and 14 Speed3 modules in a 12-beacon array, you hit that 20% floor and still get a ??% speed increase ((Souble-check these numbers...)).  See?  I told you they have a use.  And if you have anything to say about that, come find me on the Discord and help me put together a future article!  Until then, I'll see you on the factory floor...
