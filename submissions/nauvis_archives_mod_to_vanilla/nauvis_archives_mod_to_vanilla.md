## Nauvis Archives: From Mod to Vanilla <author>stringweasel</author>

Factorio has a very rich modding communnity. There's mods for almost anything you can think of. From complete overhaul mods like Space Exploration or Krastrio, to small quality of life mods like Far Reach, to the ability to listen to [KnighRider music while you're driving](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/JKIL-KnightRider). There are even mods with over 1 million downloads. But, the greatest honor a modder can likely achieve is to have the mod incorporated into the vanilla game. 

The developers can focus on making sure the game engine is perfect and optimized, while the modders can freely explore different ideas. SovietWomble has a [great series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtNtbPuUdFc&ab_channel=SovietWomble) on this idea, but unlike ARMA, Wube adds the mods that the players really enjoy or need, as long as it fits in their vision.

THIS DOESN'T WORK.

There are various instances of where mods was incorporated into vanilla that most of you will know about. For example: [train fluid tankers](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RailTanker), the [ability to barrel any liquid](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Omnibarrels) (initially you could only barrel crude oil), [Landfill](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=27982#p27982), to name only a few. There is even a case where an active modder was incorporated into vanilla when [Rseding joined the Wube team](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-300).



### The Picker Tool (using Q)

In the old days of Factorio you could not simply place `Q` while hovering over a building and have it magically appear in your cursor. You had to find it in your inventory or in you quick bar. And you also had to make sure you had items left in your quickbar, since in those days it was a [seperate inventory](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-191) and not simply shorcuts. So what were we to do? A modder named Tinyboss saw this oppertunity first and make the [Picker](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=14695) [mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Tinyboss/picker). After Tinyboss a while he allowed the renown modder Nexela take over maintaining it, who then created the [Picker Extended Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerExtended).

### Personal Roboport

But what would a personal roboport be without the use of blueprints?

### Blueprints

Blueprints is a very important feature on Factorio. Without it it would be frustratingly tedious to expand your factory, build another outpost, do train networks, etc. I would not want to play Factorio today without blueprints. But, this was also a mod before it was accesable to everyone.
