 Looked up to 0.15


Factorio has a very rich modding communnity. There's mods for almost anything you can think of. From complete overhaul mods like Space Exploration or Krastorio, to small quality of life mods like Far Reach, or even to listen to [KnighRider music while you're driving](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/JKIL-KnightRider). There are even mods with over 1 million downloads. However, the greatest honor a modder can likely achieve is to have the mod incorporated into the vanilla game. 

The developers can focus on making sure the game engine is perfect and optimized, while the modders can freely explore different ideas. SovietWomble has a [great series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtNtbPuUdFc&ab_channel=SovietWomble) on this idea, but unlike ARMA, Wube adds the mods that the players really enjoy or need, as long as it fits in their vision.

THIS DOESN'T WORK.

~~There are various instances of where mods was incorporated into vanilla that most of you will know about. For example: [train fluid tankers](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RailTanker), the [ability to barrel any liquid](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Omnibarrels) (initially you could only barrel crude oil), [Landfill](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=27982#p27982), to name only a few.~~ There is even a case where an active modder was incorporated into vanilla when [Rseding joined the Wube team](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-300).

Oldest version in Roadmap is 0.4, 3 May 2013

I downloaded these mods and tried to use them.

### Fluids: Barrels and Fluid Wagons



### The Picker Tool (The Q-key)
[*by Nexela*](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerExtended)

https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/67hsjj/the_new_pipette_tool/

In the old days of Factorio you could not simply press `Q` while hovering over a building and have it magically appear in your cursor. No, you had manually to find it in your inventory or in you quick bar. And if you used your quickbar you also had to search through unwanted items, since in those days it was a [seperate inventory](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-191) and not simply shorcuts. A modder named Tinyboss saw this constant struggle and made the original [Picker](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=14695) [mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Tinyboss/picker). After a while Tinyboss [allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/67hsjj/the_new_pipette_tool/dgs9aa3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the renown modder [Nexela](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Nexela) take over the mod's maintenance, who then created the [Picker Extended Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerExtended).

In Factorio 0.15 some of this mod's functionality was [included](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=50827) in the vanilla game. It should be noted that only a small part of the mod's functionality was added to vanilla. The mod is still available, and has an extensive set of extra useful features. 

### Personal Roboport
[*Originall called Pocket Bots. By JamesOFarrell*](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=4441&p=33858&hilit=pocket+bots#p33858)

A very useful feature is the personal roboport. It's so integral to expanding your base I personally would not play Factorio without it. You only need to imagine building your entire rail network by hand ([see this base that likely did](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13)), or by first covering the entire area with roboports. Not to even think about the outposts. This amazing tool was only added to vanilla starting in Factorio 0.12, which was released in 17 July 2015. Before that it was known only as Pocket Bots, and it was only available as a mod.

Pocket Bots was released on 21 June 2014 by JamesOFarrell on a Factorio Forums thread called: [*Pocket Bots: Construction bots for your pocket*](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=4441&p=33858&hilit=pocket+bots#p33858). Of course this mod became very popular and was by many. However, JamesOFarrell had to be clever to mod it into the game. It seems like he had to create a temporary logistic chest at the players feet for the robots to be able to pick up (or drop) the items. There was no other way to pick it up directly from the players inventory. It had other quirks as well, like only working outside your roboport coverage, but that is where it typically was most used.

The developers noticed how popular and useful this mod was, and almost exactly a year later the vanilla [Personal Roboport](https://wiki.factorio.com/Personal_roboport) was teased in [Factorio Friday Facts #92](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-92) in preperation for Factorio 0.12. It should be noted that in Factorio 0.12 there was only one personal roboport type, and no upgraded MK2 version. This meant to have 100 personal construction robots you had to have 10(!) personal roboports. It wasn't until Factorio 0.17, released on February 2019, that we received the [Personal Roboport MK2](https://wiki.factorio.com/Personal_roboport_MK2), which allowed you to fit 100 bots in your pocket using only 4 Personal Roboport MK2s.

### Blueprints

Blueprints is a very important feature on Factorio. Without it it would be frustratingly tedious to expand your factory, build another outpost, do train networks, etc. This feature has been on the wishlist a long time for Factorio's creator, kovarex. This can be seen in his [forum post](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=6&p=7&hilit=blueprint#p7) from 2013 - when Factorio was still in infancy - where they were still deciding in what direction to take the game. But, it was not the developers who got to implement it first. No, the original creator was a modder named *drs9999*.

*Caption: The Blueprints technology screen as shown in Factorio 0.7. The little yellow robot is the old Robotics Technology icon. It's also used as the mod's nanobots - more on that later.*

This mod was first posted on the Factorio Forums on 13 March 2013 - just over a month after kovarex mentioned blueprints in the aforementioned forum and before Factorio 0.4. These blueprints did not work nearly as intuitively as they do today. This is simply because the game was just over a year old at the time. There wasn't construction bots back then, or even a roboport. The lonely logistic bots just hovered around. But most importantly, mod functionality were not nearly as extensive as it is today. 

To circumvent these limitations the creator created markers that you can place down. These markers was used to designate an area to either save as blueprint or where to place down a saved blueprint. There was even an option to select an area to upgrade. You then required nanobots (the little yellow bots in the picture above) in your inventory that was then expended to build the blueprint in the designated area. The creator made a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/jpekc8DchQg) for more information. Below you can see a quick demonstration that I put together:

Blueprints were added to Factorio 0.9 on 14 February 2014, which means this mod was the only way to duplicate any part of your factory for over a year. And although it was deprecated quite quickly, it *most likely* influenced other massive mods to be created, like [Nanobots by Nexela](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Nanobots) and [Upgrade Planner](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=92&t=14781). It can also be noted that more blueprint features were modded before vanilla, like [blueprinting trains](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/blueprint-train) by DaveMcW and [mirroring blueprints](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/blueprint_flip_and_turn) by NovaM.


### Blueprint String

A blueprint string is used to [import and export blueprints](https://wiki.factorio.com/Blueprint#Importing.2FExporting_blueprints) to and from you game. This can be anything from nuclear builds, rail network, or perfect-ratio solar blueprints. And as you might guess, this was also a mod before it was native to vanilla. We know that blueprints were added to vanilla in Factorio 0.9, but soon after that people wanted to start [sharing](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=2697&p=19833&hilit=blueprint#p19833) their blueprints. And as always, a modder came to the rescue. This time it was JamesOFarrell again, the guy that brought us PocketBots, who created a famous mod called [Foreman](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=6516).

![](media/foreman.png)

*Caption: The Foreman GUI as seen in game (taken from the [forum post](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=6516)).*

However, technically JamesOFarrell was not the first to implement the blueprint string, because his mod didn't originally create a blueprint string! Rather, the main feature of the Foreman mod was the managing of blueprints, because although there was blueprints, there was no blueprint books yet. Blueprints clogged up your inventory very quickly which prompted a better managing system. One of the features was simply a method to import/export these blueprints. And as I mentioned, it didn't create blueprint strings, but rather a small snippet of Lua code! Below is an reduced piece of the `*.blueprint` file that it created that could be read with any text editor as example.

```
do local blueprintData={icons={[1]="fast-transport-belt",[2]="boiler"},entities={[1]={type="transport-belt",position={x=-8.5,y=-3.5},name="fast-transport-belt",orientation=0,direction=4,entitynumber=1},[2]={type="transport-belt",position={x=-8.5,y=-4.5},name="fast-transport-belt",orientation=0,direction=4,entitynumber=2},[3]={type="pipe-to-ground",position={x=-7.5,y=-4.5},name="pipe-to-ground",orientation=0,direction=2,entitynumber=3},[4]={type="inserter",direction=4,filters={[1]={index=1},[2]={index=2},[3]={index=3},[4]={index=4},[5]={index=5}},conditions={red={count=5,operator=">",name="raw-wood"},logistics={operator=">",count=1},green={operator=">",count=1}},entitynumber=4,orientation=0,connections={red={[1]=74},green={}},name="smart-inserter",position={x=-6.5,y=-3.5}},[5]={type="boiler",position={x=-6.5,y=-4.5},name="boiler",orientation=0,direction=0,entitynumber=5}, ... name="PowerSmart"};return blueprintData;end
```

And as you might imagine, this resulted in very large blueprint files and it became unwieldly very quickly. There was discussions about how reduce the blueprint's footprint, for example by using zip files, but nothing resulted in a robust implementation and maintain ease-of-use. However, less than two weeks after Foreman was released, a famous modder called DaveMcW solved this problem. (If you don't know this name yet, see this [article](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13/)). He solved the blueprint size problem by compressing the mentioned code snippet using a `gzip + base64` format.
