## Tell us about you! <author>Conor_</author>

Building and running has been a great pleasure for the Alt-F4 Team but up until now we've been working under a few assumptions which we'd like to update with some hard data. These assumptions came from poor user reporting tools which we have since retired, so here I am asking you to answer a couple anonymous polls to tell us more about you! No personally identifiable data is being collect, and all the results are publicly viewable. We'll use this data to help guide where we want take Alt-F4 going into the future.

Firstly, we want to know which type of device you read Alt-F4 on, to allow us to continue to optimize the website and make the reading experience better.

Secondly, our translation teams put a huge amount of effort into localising the website and we want to know which language you usually ready Alt-F4 in and/or which language you would like to read Alt-F4 in.
