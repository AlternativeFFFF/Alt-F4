## Tell us about you! <author>Conor_</author>

The Alt-F4 Team has been working with a few assumptions up until now which we'd like to update with some hard data. These assumptions came from poor user reporting tools that we used previously, so instead of relying on those, we're asking you to answer a couple of anonymous polls to tell us more about you! No personally identifiable data is being collected, and all the results are publicly viewable. We'll use this data to help us guide the direction of Alt-F4 in the future.

First, we'd like to know which type of device you read Alt-F4 on so we can continue to optimize the website's layout and accessibility.

Our translation teams put a huge amount of effort into localising the website and we want to know which language you usually ready Alt-F4 in and/or which language you would like to read Alt-F4 in.

Finally, we'd like to know what you want to see more of on Alt-F4.
