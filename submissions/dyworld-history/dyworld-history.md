# DyWorld-Dynamics and it's history <author>Dysoch</author>

Hello everybody, my name is Dysoch, and I'm the creator of all the Dy mods. In this article I will write a bit about my many years of history with modding Factorio, and the next exciting release that I have been working on for almost a year. But first, I will explain where it all started.

## History ##
When I bought Factorio, I was already playing it for a year, but officialy bought it when Factorio 0.7 was in development. I simply loved the game, but felt it could be better. So I started modding. I had no idea what I was doing, but luckily a nice guy by the name of [FreeER](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=190&t=1568) came to aid me, and learned me to code properly. I had several breaks over the years where I was burned out on modding or had too much to do in my life, but I always have an itch to come back.

When I started to mod, there was only 1 major overhaul mod, called F-Mod (which's old forum page is unfortunately no longer available). I wanted to have the same as that mod, and started. It was clunky in the beginning, but after years off hard work the DyTech franchise touched every aspect of the game. I rewrote it several times under somewhat the same name, but the content stayed mostly the same. By rewriting, I learned to code it better, easier to read and edit things. I always had several ideas that were a little out of reach for me, but I always strived to make planets into Factorio since I started modding. Luckily Earendel did that now, and I can work on other projects

DyTech was very populair back in the day. Eventually it got it's own section on the [Factorio Forum](https://forums.factorio.com/viewforum.php?f=190) I even played together a few times with Xterminator and Oninaig while they were doing a lets play on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGuc-OVRE94). After a few years (Factorio 0.15) I started to work on the next step of DyTech, DyWorld. A major rewrite after 2 years of no modding, to fit DyTech better into the ever evolving Factorio. This mod was better developed, had more exciting features. Started experimenting with heated furnaces and features that complimented that. I made great strides, and worked on it till just before Factorio 1.0.0. Several content creators played it on Youtube:

About August of last year my itch to mod was back, bigger then before. I decided to rewrite the mod, and add the content of the mod around 1 very specific thing in mind: A story. Thus I rewrote DyWorld into DyWorld-Dynamics.
But it is now almost a year later, and it is still not released. Well, due to some personal issues I could not do anything a few months. When that was taken care of, I returned to keep working on it. And now it is getting closer to release. Adding in content around a story is much more work then I previously anticipated, but it is fun to do. Luckily I have several beta testers to help me take care of issues while I write everything.

## The Story ##

This is my main focus of DyWorld-Dynamics. I wrote everything with the story elements in mind, but it will work without it as well. What is the story about?

The story starts with crash landing on a desolate planet, filled with weird flora and fauna. You have no idea how you got there and where you are. As the story progresses, you name the planet, find out why you crash landed there, learn about other planets and move there and find an epic conclussion of the story. The conclussion will give you an nice history of fictional space fairing humans, and its encounter with a mysterious force.

This is what will be available once it publicly releases. 3 Acts of story, with multiple objectives, and travelling between planets powered by the beautiful [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration) mod. The first two acts will learn you the basic mechanics of DyWorld-Dynamics with its complex recipes, and act 3 will completly focus on the story element that you can check out on your own pace. There are several mechanics added into DyWorld-Dynamics, such as an Survival system that increases player bonuses (such as mining speed, building reach etc) based on what you do, food and water usage, implant usage, scripted attacks and many more.

Recipes are fun and complex as well, feedback loops, science packs creation with actual fluids, space mining, tree farming, agriculture and so much more. This will all tie nicely into Space Exploration, while keeping it intact the cool way it is.
[Informatron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/informatron) is used to display many types of information, about surroundings, mechanics and even the story can be reread there

## Release Date ##

Currently work is hard under way to get the mod ready. Many small things still have to be done, but it will be ready soon. Since KatherineOfSky played a concept of [DyWorld-Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4o6UvJIdPNp1ca01l6rci52uIL6oWYWN) when it was just starting, she will have exclusivity to play it publicly before anybody else. I am currently aiming to get the finished mod to her on 30th of July. This is still an estimate, but I think I can manage that. Once she has it, a public release is only 1-2 weeks after that.

As for right now, I will leave you with the start of the story, and I hope to see you all playing DyWorld-Dynamics once it releases, and be sure to stay up to date over on [DyWorld Discord](https://discord.gg/yR5vBWy). I post regular updates on it's development over there
