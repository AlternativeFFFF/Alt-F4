# DyWorld-Dynamics and it's history <author>Dysoch</author>

## Learning to code ##
Hello everybody, my name is Dysoch. I am a Factorio modder for about 8-9 years now. The first mod I ever released was DyTech which was for Factorio 0.7 and 0.8. 
I had just started modding at that point, and my mod was not pretty. Missing technologies, weird balancing. Basically, I had no idea what I was doing. DyTech just had extra things like higher tiers of solar panels, assembling machines, transport belts, etc. I wrote everything by hand, it was tedious, horrible and a lot of fun to do.

Eventually I came into contact with a person on forum called FreeER. He helped me create scripts and thaught me how they worked. This gave me a lot of idea's, and I started to rewrite DyTech

## DyTech-Dynamics ##
I started to work on a mod along side DyTech, called DyTech-Dynamics. This mod was basically a random mod. Every scripted idea I had, went into this. A different way to research, random power failures, random damages of machines etc. This was a made very clunky, but it served a purpose. This allowed me to learn to write codes and scripts better.
And while I did all that, I kept working on DyTech as well, and writing more stuff into it. It had basically already become an major overhauled, that worked together with F-Mod (from Ficolas)

## The next step ##
I had learned so much over a year since I started modding, and thus I rewrote DyTech again. I started with many sub mods (like Bob's mods), and thus DyTech 3 was born, called [Core]-DyTech. I wrote many [Main] mods ([Main]-DyTech-Logistics, [Main]-DyTech-Assembling, [Main]-DyTech-Power) but I focused on 2 of them:

### [Main]-DyTech-Warfare ###
This started to get my main focus. I really loved the automation aspect of the game, but always felt the fighting part was a bit stale. So I worked on making the natives a lot harder, add fun mechanics into it, a lot more enemies etc. This was fun, but some people didn't like it, which they can of course, but it seemed to lose interest from the players. So I shifted my attention into the next mod:

### [Secondary]-DyTech-Dynamics and [Secondary]-DyTech-World###
This mod featured a lot random things. Things from tools like Tinkers Constructs from Minecraft, to a different way to research based on stuff done, random power failures, etc. It was a lot of fun to make, but took ages. I worked on this so much, that I started to work less on DyTech it self, and eventually I burned out on modding

## DyTech 4 ##
After a 1,5 year stop in modding, I can back with new idea's. I rewrote again, into DyTech 4 basically. This happened really quick, since I knew how to script now, so I made the entire mod script generated.
This made sure I could write quick, and implement my idea's quickly. This worked great, untill my real life became hectic and I left again

## DyWorld ##
The time in Factorio is now version 0.15, I came back after 2 years since I last rewrote DyTech, and when into a complete rewrite mode. New name, new everything. This took months to create, but the result was highly loved by some people. A few youtubers played it, and liked it. ([KoS DyWorld Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4o6UvJIdPNqubR5oXdx9SqKFoYW_SL-q))
I worked a lot on this, and then 0.18 came, worked on it some more, and then left again for about a year. In this time, factorio released 1.0, but my life was hectic (once again)

# DyWorld-Dynamics #
About august of last year my itch to mod was back, bigger then before. I started on the next rewrite. I rewrote DyWorld into DyWorld-Dynamics, with 1 very specific thing in mind: A story.
I am creating a story mode into a game about automation, I must be crazy right? Well I am, but it turned out be so much fun to do and create. But it is now almost a year later, and it is still not released. Well, due to covid-19, I lost my job, and had to focus on keeping my life in order to be able to live normally. When that was taken care of, I returned to keep working on it. And now it is getting closer to release. So lets talk about what is in this mod:

> A fun, exciting, and long story:

This is the main part of DyWorld-Dynamics. The story is all I work on. Everything I add in, is made for the story. The story consists of 5 acts, each with multiple phases. Currently 2 acts are done (about 21 phases total), and I am now working on the third act. (about 50 phases, very large story arc)

> Other Mods:

I had several idea's for the story, but rather then writing them all myself, I decided to use other mods as required. This list is slowly growing, but the largest of these is Space Exploration by Earendel. The story will span across multiple planets. 
Adding in compatibility with Space Exploration took a long while. So many little things to fix, making sure not to destroy the progression of Space Exploration, etc. Well, this is almost done, so a public release is within 1,5 month away

> Complex, but fun mechanics

DyWorld, and its previous iterations, always had somewhat of a RPG system built in. This increases player bonuses and allows you to become stronger the more you do. This is back in, but greatly expanded and actually fully incorporated into the story. Other mechanics are fluid creating recipes for science packs, complex feedback loops, and many more.
The first 2 acts of the story help you progress, and will tell you how to get into this. The third act wil let this go, and you will be on your own (well, Multiplayer is fully supported, so no need to be alone)

> How to help?

Currently I am running a closed beta test for balancing purposes, and I can require a lot of help with this. You can help there, and info about that can be found on the [DyWorld Discord](https://discord.gg/yR5vBWy).
Before you do this, be sure to check out another playlist from KatherineOfSky, which had a first look at the concept of a [DyWorld-Dynamics Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4o6UvJIdPNp1ca01l6rci52uIL6oWYWN)

> When can I play this?

Currently the release date of DyWorld-Dynamics is set to July 26th 2021, BUT this is an estimate. It can be later, but I am doing my best to reach for this.
