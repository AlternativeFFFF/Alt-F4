## I love Factorio because of Burner Inserters <author>Goose</author>

While there are various aspects of factorio to be loved for, my hands
down favorite is the unfixed creativity of design, particularly with the
burner inserter. They are one of the slowest, least efficient and most
burdensome machines to build with in the game. Most players wouldn't
craft more than a handful of them and I've built whole factories using
exclusively burner inserters. With their low speeds and fuel insertion
requirements, many burner inserters must be built in conjunction to
achieve similar results to faster electric inserters. With as
claustrophobic as this becomes, critical thinking is required for each
and every design to attain the most throughput. This restriction has
pushed me to build more creatively than I ever have and really tested my
knowledge of the deeper mechanics of the game.
