## I love Factorio because of Burner Inserters <author>Goose</author>

While Factorio has many aspects that are worthy of love, my hands-down favorite is the unfixed creativity of design, particularly using the burner inserter. It is one of the slowest, least efficient and most burdensome machine to build with. Most players wouldn't craft more than a handful of them, while I have built whole factories using exclusively burner inserters. With their low speed and fuel insertion requirements, many burner inserters must be built in conjunction to achieve similar results to faster electric inserters. With as claustrophobic as this becomes, critical thinking is required for each and every design to attain optimal throughput. This restriction has pushed me to build more creatively than I ever have and really tested my knowledge of the deeper mechanics of the game.
