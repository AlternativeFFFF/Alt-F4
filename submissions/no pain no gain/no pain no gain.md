## What annoys players the most
It depends on player what annoys them the most in factorio, for me cliffs are devilish idea, xterminator will scream at trains and somebody else will say that missplaced landfill is the worse. So I've ask our community on reddit "What is the most annoying thing in factorio" and answers was divided.

*insert screen from reddit* *insert some interesting graphs based on answers*

**I need to wait for reddit pool to write something more**

### Painful things that got removed
**Something about mechanics that was removed/upgraded like: old toolbar, old blueprints management, upgrade planner, old oil processing, fluids system, replacing belts**

Every game developer tries to make their game the best on the market. Factorio devs put a lot of effort to make their game very intuitive and fun to play without taking advanced mechanics from the game.

I think many people would agree that factorio is "easy to play, hard to master" type of game, because you can start playing it without any knowledge and know what you are doing and what you need to do next, but it wasn't always like that.

Not that long ago oil processing was one of the most complicated things to do for beginners: pipes, liquids, oil extracting or difference building for refining. All of this was overwhelming for first time player, so devs needed to make solution and they did. First tier of oil processing now producing only one most important liquid(Petroleum gas) at the time, what made problem with blocking refineries disappear. Also now you cannot connect two pipes with difference fluids inside and that make refineries way easier to build. What's more, if some of your pipes got wrong liquid inside, you can just open it and delete whole "Fluid system contents" wit one click.

**I think I should write something more about differenced upgrades done to the game or expand fluids topic**

### All your factorio pain in one video...
You might already saw this video, because it was quite popular on reddit and now is going viral on YouTube, but if not then this video collected (almost) all painful things from factorio like <s>xterminator<s> being killed by a train or looking at your stuck spidertrone, into fast paced compilation.

To make this kind of "cinematic" videos is good to know [factorio console](https://wiki.factorio.com/Console) and [map editor](https://wiki.factorio.com/Map_editor). Because it gives you ability to build big factory in no time, modify researches and for example speed up time. There are many great commands what you can use and whole list is on [factorio wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Console). It is also interesting, that Factorio trailers used special prepared [Lua scripts](https://www.lua.org/about.html), like we can read in description: "All the actions, movement and logic in general in the trailer are controlled by the game native modding system (Lua scripting)". Whole necessary [factorio API](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/) needed to work with Lua is well described on official website.

With the help of the above-mentioned technics, I've build very interesting machines that are useless in every aspect and their only purpose was to deal maximum amount of pain. There is a small list with explanation.
I wanted to show cumulative "Train out of fuel" alert and to do this, I simply stopped time in editor and make 10 pointless rails circles. In every circle, I've placed one locomotive and setup schedule for infinite repetitions. As time was stopped, there was no problem to put one more wood to each subsequent locomotive. When everything was ready, I exited editor mode to start time and recorded appearing pop-ups.
Second machine was used to make yt thumbnail and it's just four locomotives connected to one circuit condition and set up to travel straight no matter what. You can also see simple self-timer made out of belts to have time for taking best position.

### No pain, No gain
Factorio has come a long way (8.5 years) to be right where it is :)
