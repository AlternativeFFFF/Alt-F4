## The Small Annoyances of Factorio <author>trupen</author>

The most annoying thing about a particular video game heavily depends on the person playing it. For example, I personally feel like cliffs are a devilish idea, while xterminator screams at trains, and someone else complains about misplaced landfill being the absolute worst. So, to answer this question in some kind of scientific way, I’ve [polled the Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/ishfwd/altf4_needs_your_help_to_find_the_most/), asking “What is the most annoying thing in Factorio?” The responses were divided:

```mermaid!
pie title Results
         "Cliffs" : 382
         "Mixed belts (by mistake)" : 284
         "Bots (recharging speed, speed, buildings limits, overall)" : 134
         "Trees and removing them" : 168
         "The entire fluid system" : 225
         "Power poles spaghetti connecting" : 397
```

Thanks to everyone who took part in the survey and expressed their opinion. The results show that the most annoying thing for players is “Power poles spaghetti connecting.” This isn’t too surprising to me because many Factorio players focus on keeping their factory in pristine shape by using correct ratios, proper train names, or a [main bus design](https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Main_bus).

The main issue with power poles is that the cable connections don’t get saved in blueprints. So, no matter how pretty they look when you create it, this one little detail will not be retained. This gets more noticeable when you’re at the megabase stage and most of your layouts are stamped down using blueprints. It seems we’re in luck though as kovarex [hinted](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/ijf3qw/why_arent_copper_wires_treated_the_same_a_signal/g3gbobb/) that this pain point will be a distant memory once 1.1 hits.

I also took a look at the most upvoted comments because, while they might have fewer votes than the poll results, they unearth some truth nonetheless. [u/Conor\_\_\_\_\_\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Conor_______/), in particular, hits upon something that most of us will be familiar with:

Another comment that jumped out to me was [u/Mr_Shteeveey](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Shteeveey/) bringing up the pain of switching your power armour incorrectly. For those that don’t know, power armour gives you an additional 10-30 inventory slots, and removing it when you have a full inventory causes the surplus to [spill on the ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/6x2syi/what_happens_when_you_take_off_your_power_armor/) all around you, requiring you to clean it up manually while enduring the shame of what you just did.

### Painful things that got removed

Every developer tries to make their game the best on the market. Wube puts in a lot of effort to make Factorio very intuitive and fun to play without having the advanced mechanics suffer. I think many people would agree that it is an “easy to play, hard to master” type of game, because you can start playing without any knowledge and still know what you are doing and what you need to do next.

It wasn’t always like that though. After we took a look at what people find bothersome in today’s Factorio, I thought it would be fun to look back at some older mechanics that didn’t really work out. For one, there was the alien artifacts mechanic that we explored in [Alt-F4 #6](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-6/#alien-artifacts-a-primitive-technology) and which distracted you from factory building quite a bit.

Another annoying thing were pickaxes. In Minecraft, you need an iron pickaxe to mine diamonds, but you need wooden and stone versions to get to iron in the first place. Factorio was inspired by this idea and also had four different types of pickaxes used to mine higher ‘tiers’ of resources. The wood and stone variants were removed very early on as this type of resource gathering in the early game was just a distraction from the core gameplay.

Iron and steel axes, however, remained in the game for a long time. The [iron axe](https://wiki.factorio.com/Iron_axe) was a short-lived part of your progression path, crafted only once or twice to provide you with your first iron. What’s more is that new players had problems finding, crafting, or using this tool, creating some frustration in the first few minutes you spend in the game. The [steel axe](https://wiki.factorio.com/Steel_axe) on the other hand was with us throughout the whole game, crafted in bulk from time to time. Both of them got removed in the end because they didn’t add much to the game, and mostly confused or annoyed players.

There are many more things like this that got removed over time. Many early access games get a lot of new buildings, mechanics, or enemies over time, but Factorio chose a different path; instead of adding more, they improved what was already there.

If you want to read Wube’s thoughts on this kind of clean up, take a look at [FFF 266](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-266) which goes into detail about the decisions regarding pickaxes, furnace efficiency, and more. Also be on the lookout for next week’s issue of Alt-F4, in which stringweasel will dive into some more of these for the Nauvis Archives.

### No pain, No gain

Factorio has come a long way during the more than eight years of development to be where it is today. Mistakes were made, but the developers didn’t pretend that everything was perfect right away and worked very hard to make Factorio a wonderful game for casual players and veterans alike.
