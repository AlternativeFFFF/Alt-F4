## Mod Spotlight: Space Exploration

Space Exploration is an overhaul mod that takes you on an epic journey through the stars. It’s packed with new challenges, original mechanics, and unique experiences. Here's my story:

I launch a rocket, with a satellite of course, and unlock satellite mode. Now I can see the world from “Satellite View”, detached from my body. My quest to find the edge of the planet just got a lot easier and… yup, there’s the edge. Nauvis is limited. 

But what’s this? My satellite also discovered something abandoned in my planet’s orbit. I can look at it with the satellite, some sort of space platform with some treasures I want… You know what that means: time to go to space in person. 

![Planet map: My home base. Solar system map: My home world. Interstellar map: My star system.](space-exploration-you-are-here.png "You are here")

So I build up my base and launch a cargo rocket full of materials, jump in and hit launch. Riding the rocket is a rush, and the feeling of floating around in zero-G is magical. But the magic is short lived, in orbit you need to bring life support, and so without such O2 I die. I hit respawn, death was not so bad after all.

After making a new production facility for a thrustersuit and lifesupport canisters I make another attempt. I make it to space and start building my space station (trying not to cry at how expensive scaffolding is). I get to work on the first and simplest of the in-space sciences: Rocket science. It’s much more difficult than any of the science packs so far, but much easier than everything to come.

At first it is a bit surreal having two completely separate bases running in the game at the same time, but I can look back at my homeworld at any time with the satellite to order more resources to be delivered via the cargo rocket, stamp down some blueprints, copy paste things for the bots to do, even change recipes and wire things together. 

With rocket science (semi-) automated… Now it is time to look at the new tech I have access to. There are 4 data-driven sciences to choose from and they’re all pretty complicated. Each one has a different types of challenge, requires specific machines for experiments, and needs a resource I don’t have. 

![Choose your path through data-driven science... So many things I want.](space-exploration-tech-lure.png "Space Sciences")

Energy science looks like a good choice. I would need to find a new metal called Holmium from some other planet, then figure out how to make some huge particle colliders and energy streams to make the science, but it would unlock things like the tesla gun, those sweet flat solar panels you can run on, power pylons and the game-changing wide area beacons.

Or maybe material science would be better. I would need to find some Iridium, and the science experiments would generate a lot of scrap that I’d need to process, but that would get me some better space station floor, and military upgrades, and a spacesuit with a bigger equipment grid.

Perhaps bio science would be the most efficient first choice. I would need to find some weird material from another planet called Vitamelange, and figure out how to do genetic experiments, but that would get me the bio gun, spidertron, bio upgrades, and more productivity to save resources overall.

No, I know what I want. There it is, sitting deep in the astronomic science tree, the Spaceship tech, my dream of being a spaceship captain. Astronomic science would need me to make a lot of telescopes, and will need Beryllium, and the only palace I’ve seen that so far is an asteroid belt. Unfortunately the spaceships are not under Astronomic science 1, they are under Astronomic science 3… and that is days away at best. Most of what Astronomic 1 would get me is rocket safety upgrades… which is nice. Not crashing is nice, but with the moons I’ve already found going for the other sciences would be easier.

I look away at the other techs tempting me, oh no, energy science has space trains too, so many decisions!

![Space structures](space-exploration-structures.png "Space structures")

I latch onto spaceships as my main goal, but let’s be practical. To get spaceships I would need astronomic science. To get astronomic science I would need Beryllium. To get Beryllium I would need an asteroid belt. To mine an asteroid belt effectively I need energy but the asteroid belt has bad solar. It will be easier with better energy tech, and better energy tech needs Holmium.  I can get Holmium from a nice little biterless planet right next door. Hurray!

The plan is set: Holmium moon > Energy science > Beryllium asteroid belt > Astronomic science 1 to 3 > SPACESHIPS!

So I use my fuel guzzling rockets to travel to another planet. This planet has a long day/night cycle and severe wind (RIP robots), but at least it has water and… some sort of ruin to explore? (Cut for spoilers)

Many hours later.

One planet outpost has become a few as I rocket around the solar system, grinning gleefully at the generated names. 

My 2nd planet was lacking a few important resources such as iron and... water. Yes water, one of those things you just take for granted until you can’t get it anymore. Fortunately its moon has iron and water in abundance. Water is not the nicest thing to transport from planet to planet, or moon to planet because of all the barrels. Sure they’re recyclable but sending ice is much better, so that’s the next stop, and ice world. Oh how the logistic network grows..

Then an alert: a rocket from Navuis has crashed scattering all the valuable resources it contained everywhere. Clean it up construction bots, don’t leave those circuits on the ground. 

I decided to use delivery cannons to send the materials from the colony to colony. Interplanetary railguns delivering resources, what could go wrong? It just needs a bit of circuitry to not blow a crater here and there.

![Delivery cannon: Fire basic resources to anywhere in your solar system.](space-exploration-delivery-cannon.png "Delivery cannon")

I look back at the tech tree. Glancing longingly at the spaceship tech, imagining all of the planets I could go to with this technology. 

As my bases expand the cost of a rocket becomes a seemingly minor expense. The asteroid belt I need for spaceship tech seems less daunting. Branching out and getting those space trains helped me scale up, it was just a minor detour off… 30 hours? 

Enough of these distractions! I plough forth towards that spaceship tech, setting up an asteroid field mining base and building some huge telescopes for astronomical science. Nothing can stop me. I spend a moment looking at my base and realise that I set my combinators up wrong and flooded my base with stone by accident and everything has stopped. I have been stopped by stone of all things. (This will become a running theme).

Then that moment finally arrives. At long last I have finally researched the glorious spaceship technology. 

Then I look at the cost and that love turns to despair. So many valuable resources for such a small shuttle… But it is MY spaceship. I designed it myself block by block like a little rocket-propelled factory, and although I made it a little bit wonky, it works. I shall name this creation “The Penguin”. The feeling is exhilarating as I am no longer shackled to Navuis. I make a countdown machine, and launch with much fanfare. The Penguin has taken flight!

Flying towards the space station, suddenly I see asteroids coming towards the ship: Panicking I shoot the asteroids in desperation, but to no avail and they keep coming overwhelming my meager weaponry. Stop the engines! But too late, a number of asteroids hit the ship and one hits me, killing me. Thus my resolve, next time, I will put guns on my spaceship. Maybe it was fate that a ship named after a flightless bird was to be destroyed.

The natives are bugging my home base once again. Perhaps I have neglected some of my defences in recent days. So many planets so little time.

A new technology has caught my eye. Energy beaming, or more specifically the Glaive. My new spaceship is the perfect tool to set up a space station close to the sun, and beam those lovely sun rays down to my enemies They are no match for me now.

![Energy Beaming: I built the beam emitter where there is solar, I could use it for energy, but send it to my homeworld to burn bugs.](space-exploration-energy-beaming.png "Energy beaming")

Many many hours later.

I’ve discovered that I don’t need to colonise new planets in person. If I put a roboport-equipped Spidertron in a rocket to a new planet it will pop out of the crash site and can start building. I also have a little fleet of penguin tankers (my Penguin spaceship designed refittered to a fluid tanker spaceship) on some fully autonomous routes. This really is a game about automating everything. 

My main spaceship is now a massive beast with shield projectors at the front, space trains in the middle, and engineering at the back. It’s time to leave the light of solar systems and make a base in the darkness of interstellar space. To boldly go where no m… wait what what is THAT?

A Space Exploration game has a fantastic scope taking you from a burner-phase pleb to the master of an interstellar empire. Between the panic, you are constantly challenged, with massive buildings, logistic problems, and new concepts to work around. The journey is long, brutal, and all kinds of challenging, but it is also rewarding, inspiring, and truly epic. Its Space Exploration, the calm between the storms.
