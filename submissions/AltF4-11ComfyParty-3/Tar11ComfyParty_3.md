## Thanks for all the fish

As a dedication to Comfy Factorio, I would like to take the chance to share an invitation for another multiplayer event, tomorrow, November 7th, 7 PM CET. All feel welcome to play a good game, or simply drop by to have a look and share your congratulations.

[Comfy Factorio](https://getcomfy.eu/) is the largest Factorio dedicated community which emphasis on original maps and “chill” experience. Popular Comfy scenario includes Biter Battles, Mount Fortress and a little while ago, the teleporting Chronotrain.  

To celebrate the welcome to their 3000th Discord member, Comfy has teamed up with [Big Community Games](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/) to host a [Massive Multiplayer Fish Defense Game](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Fish-Defence/). 
Big Community was also in [Alt F4 #7](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-7/#join-the-bcg-mmo-event-tomorrow-t-a-r) so we skip right away to Fish Defence for the readers who haven't met the fish island yet:

Central on the map is a market full of fish. Alien biters located in the tail of the fish have gotten the smell of this treat. This means the fish has to be relocated to a safer place. The shared goal is to build the required rocket silo to perform this task. Meanwhile, the fish must get protected "At all costs!" from continuous ever growing attacks, on the east side of the base.
 
This map allows for some players to just wack biters non stop while others can focus on base building. No mods are required. 

Both hosts have shown to know how to throw a party, so I'd say "Enjoy, and have a good one!"
