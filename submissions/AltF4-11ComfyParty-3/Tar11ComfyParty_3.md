## Thanks for all the fish <author>T-A-R</author>

As a dedication to [Comfy Factorio](https://getcomfy.eu) I would like to share an invitation to another multiplayer event taking place tomorrow, November 7th, 19:00 CET. All are welcome to play, or simply drop by to have a look and share your congratulations.

Comfy Factorio is a community with an emphasis on original maps and a “chill” experience. Popular Comfy scenarios are Biter Battles, Mount Fortress, and recently the teleporting Chronotrain. To celebrate their 3,000th Discord member, Comfy has teamed up with [Big Community Games](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/), who hosted the community event mentioned in [Alt-F4 #7](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-7/#join-the-bcg-mmo-event-tomorrow-t-a-r), to host a [Massive Multiplayer Fish Defence Game](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Fish-Defence).

Let’s take a look at the map we’ll be playing; unsurprisingly, it’s in the shape of a fish:

In the center of the map is a market full of fish. Alien biters located in the tail of the fish have picked up the smell of this delicious treat, which means the fish need to be relocated to a safer place. The shared goal is to build the rocket silo required to perform this task. Meanwhile, the fish must be protected at all costs from continuous, ever-growing attacks coming from the east.

This map allows some of the participants to just whack biters non-stop while others can focus on building the base. No mods are required. Both of these hosts have shown that they know how to throw a party, so I’ll say “Enjoy, and have a good one!”
