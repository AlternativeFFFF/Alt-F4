## Thanks for all the fish <author>T-A-R</author>

As a dedication to [Comfy Factorio](https://getcomfy.eu/), I would like to take the chance to share an invitation for another multiplayer event, taking place tomorrow, November 7th, 7 PM CET. All are welcome to play or simply drop by to have a look and share your congratulations.

*Comfy Factorio* is a dedicated community with emphasis on original maps and a “chill” experience. Popular Comfy scenarios are Biter Battles, Mount Fortress, and recently the teleporting Chronotrain. To celebrate their 3000th Discord member, Comfy has teamed up with [Big Community Games](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/) to host a [Massive Multiplayer Fish Defense Game](https://www.bigcommunitygames.com/Fish-Defence/), who already hosted the community event mentioned in [Alt-F4 #7](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-7/#join-the-bcg-mmo-event-tomorrow-t-a-r).

Let's take a look at the map we'll be playing. Unsurprisingly, it's in the shape of a fish:

In the center of the map is a market full of fish. Alien biters located in the tail of the fish have picked up the smell of this delicious treat. This means the fish has to be relocated to a safer place: The shared goal is to build the required rocket silo to perform this task. Meanwhile, the fish must get protected at all costs from continuous, ever-growing attacks coming from the East.

This map allows some of the participants to just wack biters non-stop while others can focus on building the base. No mods are required. Both of these hosts have shown that they know how to throw a party, so I'll say "Enjoy, and have a good one!"
