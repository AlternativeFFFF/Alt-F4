### The Engineer's Physics-Defying Strength <author>Romner</author>

Minecraft's Steve is strong.  
Lift-billions-of-kilograms-with-no-problems-strong.  
But he doesn't even *compare* to Factorio's Engineer.

Taking the maximum of 120 inventory slots + 30 trash slots in vanilla and putting 10 nuclear reactors in each gives us 1500 reactors.  
According to [this article,](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2007/07/constructing-lot-of-nuclear-power.html) modern nuclear reactors use 40 metric tons of steel and 190m³ of concrete per MW.

Nuclear reactors in Factorio produce 40MW. Each. Oh, and there's also the neighborhood bonus, which we can account for with an equation (assuming 4 or more reactors and a 2xN reactor layout), where $n$ is the number of reactors and $P$ is the base power output of the reactor:  
$(n - 4)*P*4 + 4*P*3$  
Using this, we get a total of...  
$(1500 - 4)*40*4 + 4*40*3 = 239\ 840\mathrm{MW}$  
With the numbers from the [earlier article](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2007/07/constructing-lot-of-nuclear-power.html) and a [quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=concrete+density+kg%2Fm3&oq=concrete+density&aqs=edge.1.69i57j0l2j0i20i263j0l3.13097j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), we can calculate the total mass:  
$239\ 840 * 40 = 9\ 593\ 600$ metric tons of steel and  
$239\ 840 * 190 * 2.4 = 109\ 367\ 040$ metric tons of concrete, equals a total of  
$9\ 593\ 600 + 109\ 367\ 040 = 118\ 960\ 640$ metric **tons,** or **118 960 640 000 kilograms.**  

Now, most people would be satisfied with that number; it is much higher than what Steve can carry.  
But we can do better.  
Much better.

Remember [ALT-F4 #11](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-11/), specifically the "[Nauvis is a white dwarf](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-11/#nauvis-is-a-white-dwarf)" article by pocarski?

In that article, he calculated that the density of Nauvis has to be at least 813 400kg/m³ for itself to not fall apart.  
Earth has 5 510kg/m³, around 147.6225x less; which, assuming that Nauvis is comparable to Earth in terms of size, also means around 147.6225x the gravity. Which means that Factorio's Engineer can carry:  
$813\ 400 : 5\ 510 * 118\ 960\ 640\ 000 = 17\ 561\ 267\ 618\ 148\mathrm{kg}$ or so worth of nuclear reactors.

**17 561 267 618 148 kilograms.  
Seventeen and a half *trillion* kilograms.**

But we aren't done yet, nonono.  
You see, using pocarski's equation on Earth gives us around:  
$\frac{3\pi}{G\ *\ 86\ 400^2} = 18.9\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, which is ~290x less than Earth's actual density of 5 510kg/m³.  
Trying it on Mars gives us a similar result:  
$\frac{3\pi}{G\ *\ 88\ 619.616^2} = 17.98\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, which is ~220x less that Mars' density of 3 930kg/m³.  
This means that an Earth-like planet should have around 200-300 times the density calculated by pocarski's equation.

That means Nauvis' density is closer to $813\ 400 * 250 = 203\ 350\ 000\mathrm{kg/m^3.}$  
Calculating the total weight with that value gives us:  
$203\ 350\ 000 : 5\ 510 * 118\ 960\ 640\ 000 = 4\ 390\ 316\ 904\ 537\ 205\mathrm{kg.}$

**4 390 316 904 537 205 kilograms.  
Almost *four and a half quadrillion kilograms.***

For comparison, that's about the total weight of *[everything ever made by humans](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/human-made-materials-now-equal-weight-of-all-life-on-earth), **four times.***  
Or, the weight of [all living things on the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)#:~:text=The%20total%20live%20biomass%20on%20Earth%20is%20about%20550%E2%80%93560%20billion%20tonnes), *eight times.*

Steve can carry around [5 billion kilograms.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/jmz6lz/actualized_maximum_weight_that_steve_can_hold/) That is around *870 000 times less*.  
Steve is weak. Actually no, not weak... his carrying weight is so much lower than the Engineer's that calling Steve "weak" is an overstatement.  
Comparing Steve to the Engineer is like comparing an ant to an elephant.
