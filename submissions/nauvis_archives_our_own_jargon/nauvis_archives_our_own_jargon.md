## Nauvis Archives: Factorio Jargon <author>stringweasel</author>

In any established community, a form of [jargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon) is created over time. A selection of words that only people from that community will understand the true meaning of. For example, for Satisfactory engineers these are words like _lizard doggo_ or _I-wish-this-was-Factorio_. For our native biters, these are words like _rooarre_, _wrrii_, or _chrokk_ (see [ssilk](https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=507)’s explanation [here](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=63040&start=40)). And—just as any thriving community—we also have a few phrases we have made our own.

### Underneathies

This is a word we’ve heard well-known players use (such as our beloved [KatherineOfSky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTIV3KbAvaGEyNjoMoNaGtQ)) when talking about [underground belts](https://wiki.factorio.com/Underground_belt). And it’s also used on Reddit. For example when [/u/excessionoz](https://www.reddit.com/user/excessionoz/) accidentally [destroyed his mall](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/9s7x30/tip_be_very_sure_of_your_circumstances_when/) (another example of jargon) using the [Upgrade Planner](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/upgrade-planner) mod. So where did this odd word come from?

Well, it all started on the 9th of March 2017. On this fateful day, [/u/Dynamic_Gravity](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dynamic_Gravity/) had an ~~argument~~ debate with his girlfriend about what an underground belt was really called. They couldn’t come to an agreement, so they turned to the *experts* on Reddit and created [a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5yi071/need_your_help_in_settling_a_debate_with_gf/). And *that* poll—which his girlfriend so avidly defended—contained the word _underneathies_.

The rest is history, as they say. The community adopted this word into its jargon like hot cakes. It took only three days for [a mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Underneathies) to change the in-game name to underneathies (created by [/u/Suprcheese](https://www.reddit.com/user/Suprcheese/), who also brought us legendary mods like [Squeak Through](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Squeak%20Through) and [Orbital Ion Cannon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Orbital%20Ion%20Cannon)). More than three years later this word is still widely used and loved by many.

It’s fascinating how naturally this particular word was incorporated into our community. I mean, it could just as easily have been nicknamed [_undie-grundies_](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/5yi071/need_your_help_in_settling_a_debate_with_gf/deqgd0x?context=3). We probably made the right call on that one.

### Nauvis: Our Home

Expansive grass planes, dangerous red deserts, and infinitely deep lakes. A land rich in resources but inhabited by a local biter menace. This is the place we came to know and love after brutally crash landing on it. It’s our home, and we call it Nauvis.

Now, nowhere does the game actually call our planet Nauvis—the campaign simply calls it a “strange place”. Even in the ancient days of 0.13, the mission [First Steps](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=51100) simply called it “an unknown planet”. And yet, most of us know that the planet we’re all viciously polluting is called Nauvis. Why?

![First Steps Mission in 0.13](https://media.alt-f4.blog/ALTF4/9/first_steps.jpg)

Well, the game itself has various dimensions of existence—or as the code calls them—*surfaces*. And the *surface* we all live on is called [_nauvis_](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaSurface.html). However, this does not necessarily mean that it’s our planet’s name. A surface can be used to create a variety of constructs, including [space platforms](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration) and [factory floors](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2). At some point, modders realised what our main surface is called, and this knowledge was transferred to the general public.

But why *Nauvis*? What does it mean? There is no direct translation that we know of—but there are many legends. [Some say](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/7erfs8/whats_the_origin_of_the_planets_name_nauvis/dq7faa4?context=3) it’s from the Latin word [_novus_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/novus) which means new. Or, depending on how it’s pronounced, it could be from Latin word [navis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/navis) which means ship. What else would an engineer be used to calling his home when he has travelled through space for long periods of time in a ship?

Alas, we might never know what our planet was originally called—by our people or the natives. Or what the true meaning is behind the beautiful name. But, we will always call the home we’re stranded on Nauvis.
