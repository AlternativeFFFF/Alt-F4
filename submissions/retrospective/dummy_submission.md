## Retrospective <author>The Alt-F4 Team</author>


### A New Submission's Journey <author>stringweasel</author>

Alt-F4 will not be possible without the creative Factorio community continiously submitting great articles that we we can publish. And it goes through quite a few steps to reach our lovely website, where we try our best to make it reach it's true potential. We are not in the business of rejecting submissions, rather we will help you write your best piece. ADD GITHUB 

When you submit an article it will most likely arrive on my (stringweasel) doorstep first. I'll read through it and see how it can fit into our structure and content. I'll give you some feedback on how it reads, and where you could possibly expand. And don't worry, I ignore spelling and grammar, because it's definitely not my strong suit :P.  Next Nanogamer7 - our thorough fact checker - will read through your submission. He will make sure there's no accidental factual mistakes, if all the links point where you expect them to point, etc. He's like your gardian angel, and has saved my submissions a few times already.

< Maybe show one of Nano's little reviews >

Then, finally we have a look at your grammer and spelling. Here Therenas is the local friendly expert. He will improve your sentence structure and spelling and likely give you advise on how to improve it in the future. He has detangled many of my tongue twisters into smooth phrases without changing what I said. After your piece is [silky smooth]() Firerazor and his team will take over. Him and his team translate your into ? languages, from ? to ?. This team deserves a lot of praise for all the last minute translations they dedicatedly did.

Finally Conor will do the fateful merge-to-master, and it will dissapear into the Git void. This final step is a mysterious and chaotic place, but a place that has been tamed Conor and Dr. MagPie. But, like a butterfly emerges from it's cocoon, it will emerge again on our beautiful website on the Friday afternoon to be enjoyed by thousands. And here is usually when Klonan plays his duty Community Manager role and correct some mistake in your article :P


NOTES
It will end up on Github
