When I first heard about Alt-F4 being started, I immediately loved the idea and knew I had to get involved. For context, at the time I had very little to due to a/the pandemic and was desperate for a long term project to work on. I was searching high and low for anything that I could spend my time on when I found Alt-F4, I knew immediately it was the project for me. There was just the minor issue that I had no idea what I could contribute to the project. For me writing has always been a bit of a slog and I couldn’t think of any particularly good ideas for things to write about anyway so I threw my hat into the Techie ring. 

Unfortunately at the beginning, it was quite unorganized (as most projects are in the early days) so I wasn’t particularly sure what to work on. I knew very little about the website setup itself so in true Factorio spirit I decided my best option was to try and automate something. With the help of lovely_santa, I created a few github actions to automate some basic tasks such as posting new github submissions to the discord as well as the creme de la creme of github actions, the automated release. This is the only action that's survived from that first wave and has been built on since then, allowing the posting to reddit and discord entirely automagically. It also allows me the opportunity to say “Starting automation” during each release, which makes me chuckle every time. I even managed to escaped the age old issue with automation, (see [xkcd #1319](https://xkcd.com/1319/)) which is always a positive.

After a few weeks of running Alt-F4 largely single handedly, the almighty Therenas recognized his limitations and decided he needed someone to help manage the discord and github so he could focus on editing and content. Ever since that day, I have had absolutely no idea what my role in Alt-F4 is but I've had a lot of fun doing it. I went from “Techie” to “Moderator” to “Technical Editor” with the final goal of one day reaching my full potential as ~~”Lord high overload of Alt-F4”~~ “Therenas’s personal manservant”. Part of this stems from the community around Alt-F4 constantly wanting to improve and innovate, causing regular shifts in what Alt-F4 actually is. Translation was a great example of this where a single person translating a single release has led to a large translation effort headed up by Firerazer, making Alt-F4 more accessible to as many people as possible.

I really love working on this project and I knew that neither myself, nor Therenas could run it single handedly. I’ve seen amazing community projects like this one peter out after a few weeks by relying too heavily on key people who couldn’t sustain their involvement levels. This led me to push to bring on more and more people, especially in the editing process. We are first and foremost a written publication and that means that content is always and should always be our number 1 priority. My first effort to improve the quality of Alt-F4 releases was to formalise the “content editing” phase for submissions. During this, we try our darndest to bring the best out of the contributors with focused feedback about what we want more of in the submission. I believe this is one of the most important parts of Alt-F4 which sets up apart from a simple reddit post and I hope is the reason people keep coming back every week. 

After accidentally creating this role for myself, I looked for who could help with it, and luckily found stringweasel, Alt-F4’s most frequent contributor. Since coming aboard, he has worked amazingly well with the contributors to make the content as good as it can be. This is all to say, if you ever have an idea for a possible Alt-F4 submissions, no matter how big or small, join the discord and we'll be happy to discuss it and help refine your ideas. 

We also brought Nanogamer onboard to help with the accuracy after he repeatedly spotted issues during translations that all the editors missed. We chose to embody the “as many eyes as possible” philosophy with our editing process to make it as collaborative as possible.
