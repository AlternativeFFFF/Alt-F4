## Blueprints suck <author>Conor_</author>

***Mostly***, blueprints suck. First added in version `0.9.0`, blueprints allow us to create ghost copies of all sorts of machinery setups and place them anywhere in the rest of our sprawling factories. This 'copy and paste' functionality I have no issues with and I particularly enjoyed the direct copy and paste buttons and shortcuts added with the hotbar overhaul in `0.17.10`. What I cannot endorse, is the blueprint library and import string features. I think *Rseding91* said it best in his recent*ish* [AMA on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/in5d3i/developer_technicaloriented_ama/g45ay4e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

> I would never have added the blueprint library :) Not a popular opinion but I've had it ruin a few multiplayer games I was enjoying; someone comes through with a 'base in a blueprint' and all the creativity and fun is now over; it's just 'build that'.
