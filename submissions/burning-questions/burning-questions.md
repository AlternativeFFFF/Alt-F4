Factorio has a variety of fuels that can go into your burner devices, ranging from classic and modest wood, up to sci-fi level nuclear fuel. The most popular burner fuel is coal, which is the backbone of early game automation and it runs all the boilers, furnaces, vehicles, and other machines reliably until it inevitably runs low. 

In the mid game, solid fuel is introduced as the first processed fuel, made from oil. Conveniently, solid fuel is used to later make rocket fuel, which is in turn used to make nuclear fuel. These processed fuels offer noticeable advantages over coal, like having greater energy density both per unit and per stack, and they also offer an acceleration bonus when used in vehicles. More curiously, however, the late game also brings the technology to liquify good old coal and convert it into solid fuel. This raised for me the question: Does processing coal make it more energy efficient? In other words, if you liquify 10 units of coal and burn the solid fuel you get from it, does it provide more energy than the directly burning the coal? And what if you further processed it into rocket fuel? Similar questions followed and lead into this general exploration of the energy contents of different burner fuels as well as the energy costs of converting them. 

As I set off to answer these questions, a great info source was the [the wiki page for fuels](https://wiki.factorio.com/Fuel) and I approached the conversions in terms of energy produced and consumed per unit of input, rather than the production rates per building. At first I tried solving many equations with a growing list of variables, but it was much easier to convert everything into diagrams, which now summarize everything nicely. Hence, in this piece, I present some questions about different burner fuels and answer them using conversion diagrams. The results provide some interesting tidbits about how to manage your resources and they help to complete the big picture for burner fuels.

## The Questions

We begin with the question that started it all: **(1) Does processing coal into solid fuel get more energy out of it?**

We can convert the coal liquification outputs directly, but we also have cracking available, so: **(2) How much of a difference does cracking make when making solid fuel?**

Then we check how processing coal stands against the conventional way of making solid fuel: **(3) How does oil processing compare to coal liquification when producing solid fuel?**

But then we note that we don't have to stop the processing at solid fuel: **(4) Does further processing solid fuel into rocket fuel get more energy out of it?**

And then we consider going further and adding uranium: **(5) Does further processing rocket fuel into nuclear fuel get more energy out of it?**

Then we consider that uranium is already being used for a different fuel type and we consider the energy efficiency for that as well: **(6) How does burning nuclear fuel for power compare with making uranium fuel cells to "burn" in reactors instead?**

Finally, we look at the big picture and ask: **(7) How useful is fuel processing in general?**

With all the conversion options in the vanilla game, this list of questions actually covers all of the burner fuels except for wood, which is not converted into anything unless you use a [charcoal mod]([Charcoal Burner - Factorio Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CharcoalBurner)). Hence, a quick note about wood as a fuel: You may end up with a lot of it as a by product of clearing space using an axe or robots. However, it runs out quickly because of how little energy it provides. Instead of cutting trees for fuel, you would probably benefit more from using the wood to make power poles or chests, or from keeping the trees around for pollution absorption. As for other fuels, since we use conversion diagrams to answer the questions, first let's look at how they were made.

## Making Conversion Diagrams

In the diagrams, the recipes for various fuel-related crafting processes are applied. The input and output ratios are preserved but we run each process fractionally to match the input quantities rather than aiming for full cycles. Most recipes can be checked quickly from [the wiki page for oil processing](https://wiki.factorio.com/Oil_processing). The energy values of the fuels are in-game constants, referenced in [the wiki page for fuels](https://wiki.factorio.com/Fuel). The energy consumed to heat steam to 165Â°C is referenced in [the wiki page for steam](https://wiki.factorio.com/Steam). 

As for the electricity consumption during the fuel processing, it depends on the machine used and number of crafting cycles needed. Calculations are simplified a lot by the buildings using the same amount of power per second for any process. The power uses of machines are summarized in the table:

*If we use assembling machine 3 instead, the power use would be 0.375MW and crafting speed 1.25.

The total processing energy ("E") needed for a conversion can be calculated using the machine power use ("P") multiplied by the total crafting time for all of the input ("T"). This total crafting time is the duration of one crafting cycle ("d") divided by the machine crafting speed ("s"), multiplied by the number of crafting cycles ("c") to cover the entire input quantity. Hence we summarize processing energy consumption as:

`E = P * T = P * d * c / s`

Once we have the crafting recipes, fuel energy values, and the processing energy equation, we have all we need to make the conversion diagrams. Now let's look at them:

## Coal vs. liquified coal

The simple way to process coal is to just liquify it and immediately convert the outputs into solid fuel as below:

{% include image.html 

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing coal into solid fuel directly'
 caption='Processing coal into solid fuel directly' 

%}

We find that 10 coal yields 5.75 solid fuel this way. Meanwhile, the processing requires energy for heating steam and running machines. We can calculate the energy gain by subtracting all the input energy and processing energy from the output energy. Meanwhile, the percent gain is the energy gain divided by the energy obtained from directly burning the input fuel.

`Energy gain = 69 - 40 - 1.5 - 2.1 - 1.365 - 0.84 - 0.21 = 22.985MJ`

`Percent gain = 22.985MJ / 40MJ = 57.4625% `

So we see that simply liquifying the coal gets us about 57% more energy out of it. Now, can we get out even more if we use cracking?

## Adding cracking to coal liquification

Cracking adds and extra step to the process, but the looking at the recipes shows that it increases solid fuel yield: Cracking heavy oil provides 30/40 or 75% as much light oil. On the other hand, 10 light oil is enough to make 1 solid fuel  rather than 20 heavy oil, meaning that it has 200% of the yield. Combining these, by cracking heavy oil we get 75% * 200% = 150% as much solid fuel as before. 

However, the same cannot be said about cracking light oil. Cracking light oil provides 20/30 or about 66.7% as much petroleum gas, but also 20 petroleum gas is required for making solid fuel instead of 10 light oil, meaning 50% as much yield. Combining these, by cracking light oil we get 66.7% * 50% = 33.4% as much solid fuel as before, meaning that light oil cracking should be avoided.

Now to look at the process with cracking:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing coal into solid fuel with heavy oil cracking'
 caption='Processing coal into solid fuel with heavy oil cracking'

%}

We see that we now get 7.375 solid fuel from the same 10 coal instead of 5.75. That seems great but the cracking also consumes additional energy. So, let's look at total energy gain in total:

`Energy gain = 88.5 - 40 - 1.5 - 2.1 - 0.6825 - 2.8875 - 0.21 = 41.12MJ`

`Percent gain = 41.12MJ / 40MJ = 102.8% `

We find that liquifying coal and including cracking leads getting a tad more than **twice its original energy**. In other words, if you liquify coal before burning it, you only need half as much as you did before! While this suggests that liquifying coal on a large scale is a great idea, other factors like production rates need to be considered, as discussed later. 

Moving on, let us consider the other way that solid fuel is made:

## Coal vs. oil for making solid fuel

Since solid fuel can also be made out of oil, lets see how energy rich oil is compared to coal. The simplest approach is basic oil processing, which yields petroleum gas that is converted directly into solid fuel:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing oil into solid fuel with basic oil processing'
 caption='Processing oil into solid fuel with basic oil processing'

%}

We see that 100 oil produces 2.25 solid fuel. However, we know from its recipe that advanced oil processing yields more petroleum gas for the same 100 oil. On top of that, it also yields heavy oil and light oil. Hence it would better definitely use the oil more efficiently:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing oil into solid fuel with advanced oil processing'
 caption='Processing oil into solid fuel with advanced oil processing'

%}

We see that advanced oil processing yields 8.5 solid fuel from the same 100 oil. That's nearly 4 times the yield for basic oil processing! However once again, cracking the heavy oil would offer us some more energy:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing oil into solid fuel with advanced oil processing and heavy oil cracking'
 caption='Processing oil into solid fuel with advanced oil processing and heavy oil cracking'

%}

Now we see that we can get a maximum of 9.125 solid fuel per 100 oil. We can compare it with the 7.375 solid fuel from 10 coal. If we crunch these numbers, we find that 1 unit of coal produces about 8.08 times as much solid fuel as 1 unit of oil. 

Meanwhile, lets look at the total energy outputs for the best cases for each input:

`coal energy output = (88.5 - 1.5 - 2.1 - 0.6825 - 2.8875 - 0.21)MJ / 10 coal`
`coal energy output = 8.112MJ / coal`

`oil energy output = (109.5 - 2.1 - 0.2625 - 2.6775 - 1.155)MJ / 100 oil`

`oil energy output = 1.03305MJ / oil`

We find that for energy, 1 unit of coal holds about 7.85 times the energy as 1 unit of oil. This ratio lets you get an idea of how much one resource can substitute for the other when your aim is to produce solid fuel at a large scale. 

Meanwhile, there are other factors to consider when comparing coal and oil: relative abundances, transport options, and exclusive uses. Abundance simply depends on the map, so not much can be said there. As for transport options, 1 cargo wagon of 2000 coal holds about 16.2GJ of energy if converted to solid fuel. The same cargo wagon holds 400 crude oil barrels, or 20 000 oil, which gives about 20.6GJ of energy (27% more). If you use a fluid wagon instead, you can hold 25 000 oil or 25.8GJ (nearly 60% more), meaning that oil wagons transport more energy assuming you don't have to worry about transporting water/steam. Oil also has the transport option of pipelines, which may be preferable to trains in some cases. Meanwhile, exclusive uses for coal (plastic, explosives, capsules) greatly outweigh exclusive uses for crude oil (flamethrower ammo), while both can be used to make oil products. Considering all these factors together, it seems to generally be better to save most of your coal for plastic/explosive production and mostly use oil for solid fuel production, unless coal/oil abundances encourage otherwise. However, solid fuel is not the end of the fuel discussion, as we can make into rocket fuel.

## Solid fuel vs. rocket fuel

Having seen that converting coal into solid fuel offers a significant energy yield, what can we say about rocket fuel? Instead of starting from coal/oil, it is enough to just look at the recipe for rocket fuel:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing solid fuel into rocket fuel'
 caption='Processing solid fuel into rocket fuel'

%}

We see that a single unit rocket fuel contains 100MJ of energy while the raw material of 10 solid fuel already holds 120MJ, and the 10 light oil can be made into an 11th solid fuel, providing almost 12MJ more. Hence we see that there is a significant energy loss if one chooses to burn rocket fuel in furnaces or boilers. However, its higher energy density per stack and acceleration bonus makes rocket fuel great for vehicles and it is also is a necessary ingredient if we want to make nuclear fuel.

## Adding uranium

Nuclear fuel is still pretty experimental in the real world, but Factorio offers a standardized variant that is made from regular rocket fuel and uranium-235. Like with our examination of rocket fuel, the recipe itself says enough:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing rocket fuel into nuclear fuel'
 caption='Processing rocket fuel into nuclear fuel'

%}

We see that nuclear fuel offers an impressive energy output of 1.21GJ, which is [a reference](https://wiki.factorio.com/Nuclear_fuel), but also around 10 times as much energy as the solid fuel first used to make the rocket fuel. This means that if you were to switch from burning coal directly to making it into nuclear fuel to burn instead, your coal demand would drop to a tiny fraction, to as little as 1/20 as before. 

Despite its massive energy gains in terms of coal and oil savings, nuclear fuel is not perfect. The uranium-235 that it uses could instead be used to make uranium fuel cells, which provide a different energy situation:

{% include image.html

src= 'src'
 alt='Processing uranium-235 into uranium fuel cells'
 caption='Processing uranium-235 into uranium fuel cells'

%}

While uranium fuel cells can only be used inside nuclear reactors, we see that they produce energy on the level of GJ instead of MJ, and the production increases multiplicatively via the reactor neighbor bonus. Hence, up to hundreds of times more energy is gained from the same piece of uranium-235 if used in a nuclear reactor instead of nuclear fuel. This would suggest that if one has a uranium-235 supply already, they should just switch to nuclear power and electric furnaces instead of burner devices. 

However, nuclear fuel is still the best option for vehicles. It is also worth noting that nuclear fuel is unlocked alongside Kovarex enrichment, meaning that there is no shortage of uranium-235 upon unlocking it, meaning that using uranium efficiently is not critical any more.

## So how useful is fuel processing in general?

Looking back at our original questions we found out that:

(1) Coal vs. coal liquification: Liquifying coal and directly turning it into solid fuel yields 1.57 times as much energy.

(2) Coal liquification with cracking: If we also crack the heavy oil before making solid fuel, it yields 2.03 times as much energy.

(3) Coal vs. oil for solid fuel: Coal produces about 8 times as much solid fuel or energy as crude oil per unit. However, you can transport about 60% more energy in a fluid wagon of oil than a cargo wagon of coal. Meanwhile, coal has many exclusive uses it may be needed for instead of liquification while crude oil has next to none.

(4) Solid fuel vs. rocket fuel: Converting solid fuel into rocket fuel causes energy loss, but rocket fuel offers several advantages within vehicles.

(5) Rocket fuel vs. nuclear fuel: Converting rocket fuel into nuclear fuel yields around 10x as much energy as the initial solid fuel that went in, which makes it the best way to get the most energy out of your initial coal or oil. However, it is not the best way to generate power from uranium.

(6) Nuclear fuel vs. Uranium fuel cells: Using uranium-235 for nuclear reactor fuel cells yields up to hundreds of times more energy from it compared to using it for nuclear fuel but you unlock nuclear fuel alongside Kovarex enrichment, meaning that uranium-235 is not rare while nuclear fuel is available.

These findings help us answer the final question of how useful fuel processing is in general. While our main focus so far has been the energy gains from processing, I've identified a more comprehensive list of factors to decide whether fuel processing is worthwhile:

* **Gains in energy:** If you get more energy out of processed fuel, then your demand for the unprocessed fuel decreases and so your resource patches run out more slowly. We determined how each fuel stands using the diagrams above.

* **Gains in vehicle acceleration bonus and top speed bonus:** The more processed the fuel, the greater the bonuses and so the faster your vehicles can go.

* **Gains in energy density (per unit and per stack):** More energy per stack means more vehicle range per stack of fuel, which makes a big difference for trains. Meanwhile, more energy per unit means less logistics required to move fuels (fewer bots, belts, and/or trains), which simplifies things but also saves the energy that would have gone into bigger logistics. More processed fuels have greater energy density in both regards.

* **Cost of processing setup:** In terms of materials and space needed to make enough buildings for the processing, as well as the unlock cost of the required technology. Each tier of fuel requires an additional technology step.

* **Availability of more coal/oil to just use instead:** Since these resources are technically infinite on most maps, you may prefer to skip the energy gains and brute force your fuel problem by setting up more resource extraction buildings and infrastructure instead of more fuel processing buildings. This factor simply depends on your surroundings.

* **Usefulness of burner technology:** Fuel processing is not a good investment of your time and resources if burner the burner devices you are feeding have better alternatives. This factor depends on ...
  
  Â Â Â Â * * *

concs:

* **Use in vehicles:** Processed fuels fit more energy into a limited number of fuel inventory slots on trains, and they provide significant acceleration and top speed bonuses to all burner vehicles. These properties make it very worthwhile to process fuels to use in vehicles.

* **Use in other burner devices:** Since acceleration and top speed bonuses apply only for vehicles, they are not part of the fuel comparison for other burner devices. The remaining factors to consider are energy gains from processing (more gains from the same fuel means less fuel needed), the energy stored per unit or stack (using more energy-dense fuels means simpler logistic requirements like belt, bot, and wagon counts), the setup and space cost for processing (the benefits need to be worth the effort), and the availability of more raw fuel resources (which may be easier to harness than building more processing setups). Given these factors, coal liquification 

* **Use in power production**: Boilers consume tons of fuel. If you are burning through thousands of coal per hour, liquifying some of the coal or using oil to make solid fuel to burn instead is a reasonable alternative to looking for more coal. However, if you have advanced far enough to unlock coal liquification (with production science), you may want to consider switching to solar and/or nuclear power instead (as they are both unlocked far earlier). According to [my comparison of power plants](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalfactorio/comments/srosza/coal_vs_solar_vs_nuclear_setup_costs_and_running/), burner power is cheap to build but it pollutes quite a lot, which causes many biter attacks. On the other hand, solar power is expensive to set up but has no fuel requirements nor any pollution. Meanwhile, nuclear power costs only a little more than coal power when built at large scales, and it pollutes only 2-10% as much as coal power, while requiring tiny amounts of uranium compared to the coal demand of an equivalent burner power plant. As explained in [my article about nuclear power](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/t6jn29/altf4_57_nuclear_energy_and_you/), it does not require Kovarex enrichment and you can get plenty of energy from a small number of reactors and centrifuges. 

* **Use in other burner devices:** For all other burner devices, 

* **Use in furnaces**: A steel furnace consumes 90kW in burner fuel energy while an electric furnace consumes 180kW in electric energy for the same smelting speed. With that in mind, it is more energy efficient to use steel furnaces, and in that case you would benefit from producing solid fuel. However, adding 2 efficiency 1 modules to an electric furnace drops its power consumption to 72kW, making it more energy efficient to go electric. In this case, fuel processing is useful only if using burner power.

* **Use in other burner devices:** Burner mining drills consume 150kW in burner fuel energy while electric mining drills consume only 90kW in electricity. Burner inserters consume 94kW in burner fuel energy while electric inserters consume only 13kW in electricity. This makes the electric devices more energy efficient. Hence, once again, fuel processing is useful only if using burner power.

## Other notes

In particular, let us focus on converting coal into solid fuel. Getting **double the energy from your coal via liquification** is great because it cuts your coal demand in half. However, there are other factors to consider before declaring that it is better to liquify coal in general.

* **After checking production rates, setup costs may or may not suit you** - We did not look at actual production rates up until now but here is the quick version: We know that 1 refinery processes 10 coal in 5 seconds, which translates to 2 coal per second. One boiler consumes 1.8MW. In terms of coal, that is `1.8MW / 4MJ/coal = 0.45 coal per second`. In comparison, one refinery consumes enough coal for about `2 / 0.45 = 4.44` boilers. If we use heavy oil cracking after coal liquification, we know that the energy yield is doubled (2.03x). Hence, 1 refinery produces enough materials to make solid fuel for about  `4.44 * 2.03 = 9` boilers. As for processing the materials, I made a test setup (****) and (my testing suggests 5-6 because you need multiple plants to convert light oil into solid fuel fast enough***TEST) . These numbers would help you estimate if you want to invest space and resources in building all these petrochemical facilities.

* **Modules can increase energy yield** - Filling efficiency 1 modules into all the chemical plants and refineries would increase the overall energy yield by 5-10%. Meanwhile, a mixture of two or three different module types can offer the optimal energy yield per coal. Exploring the module options would maybe lead to better production rates.

* **Alternative 1: You can just use oil instead** - As previously discussed, crude oil no other uses than flamethrower ammo while coal is needed for materials like plastic or explosives, meaning that you can just get your solid fuel from oil (and burn it instead of coal).

* **Alternative 2: You can always just go and find more coal to burn instead** - Coal is generally not a rare resource after all and so you can just find more and burn more instead of processing it.

**Conclusion**

**Using modules**
