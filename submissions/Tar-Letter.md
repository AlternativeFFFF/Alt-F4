Escape to Nauvis. 

An incredible rocket ride of 8,5 years took a tiny side project into the emergence of an entire industry based on mass producing science packs. Nauvis was born. An entire alternative planet as playround for specialists, researchers, managers, engineers and artists. As an OpenTTD player i instantly felt in love with Factorio.

Unlike Earth, productivity is just an optional. This freedom invites creativity. As an artist i felt on love with the obscurities others came up with. There are always multiple ways to approach a goal. As an engineer i felt in love with the provided toolbox.

Mankind has created a history about the knowledge of mixed skills to evolve beyond what is known. The evolution of infinite aspects in the art of expanding a factory is amazing. 
As an Terran, i felt in love with the shared passion to join, teach and inspire others.
