As we all know, Spidertron was first mentioned in [FFF #120]( https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-120) with numerous future mentions. However, it was never good enough to meet the high standards of the developers to introduce it into the roadmap or ingame. I can speak for the majority of the early-access community when I say that I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the release notes of version 1.0.0! As a trustworthy mod creator, I had to take a closer look under the hood about how Spidertron is build, which could open my mind for new mod ideas to start to grow.
Like most of the mod fans of Arch666Angel already know, I am [one of the contributor to the Angels mods]( https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=475786#p475786). Since Angel�s Exploration is in a very early development stage, I could not think about a better place to put Spidertron to some good earlier game use. I will not spoil about what I have brewing, but I would rather take this moment to share some struggles in the development process. Let us meet Crawlertron, the Angel Spidertron that will join the Crawler family that is the angels vehicles. One requirement I have for my new Crawlertron is his size. I want him to be smaller, quite a bit smaller actually. This meant I had to introduce a scaling factor to the Spidertron definitions in order to be able to scale him down. For the mod creators that had a look already at the prototype definitions, he has one of the largest prototypes that Factorio has. After a few hours and a few cups of deliciousness later, after defining everything with a scaling factor, I could start loading up the game to see my result. Scaling Crawlertron down (scaling factor < 1) would not show me obvious mistakes in my coding, so I decided to upscale him instead (scaling factor > 1)...

As you probably noticed, his legs are looking like small sticks! It�s a wonder that he hasn�t broken a leg yet! Back to my Crawlertron leg definitions, I could not find anything wrong with it, so I chose to ask for help in the discord modding channel. Even Klonan said that it would require some Factorio engine rewrite to allow his legs to scale correctly. In the meantime, Klonan asked to scale him down, see if it would actually scale...

Well.. I guess you can spot what the issue is here, the legs are too thick and long, as expected, since the legs didn�t scale. So now you can see that not everything works directly out of the box, which can have some fun side effects. I am sure this will be fixed in a future update, in the meantime I already made [a bug report](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=88180) to the developers about it. I may come back in a future update to showcase you what Crawlertron has become, and how his legs have healed.
