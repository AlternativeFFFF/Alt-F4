Twas the 12th of December when all through our ship<br>
Not a computer was working, not even a blip.<br>
The Red Circuit team was all snug in discord<br>
With hopes you join us and bring more aboard!<br>
When from the ship there came a loud crash<br>
All jumped off board for it was all smash<br>
We looked all around to see alien snow<br>
With copper, and coal, and uranium all aglow!<br>
A factory to build in the cold winterland<br>
With your help it could be amazingly grand!<br>
Come join us this day at 12 UTC<br>
And build a factory for the whole world to see!
