## Santa Factory - Red Circuit Event <author>Dr_Doof</author>

Red Circuit is committed to creating presents for Santa! They invite you to join their [Factorio Santa Factory event](https://red-circuit.org/events/?e=Santa%20Factory) this Saturday 12th December at 12 noon UTC. It will be modded slightly to help you feel that winter feeling, and science packs are replaced by presents for Santa. We hope to see you there!

â€™Twas the 12th of December when all through our ship<br>
Not a computer was working, not even a blip.<br>
The Red Circuit team was all snug in [Discord](https://discord.red-circuit.org)<br>
With hopes you join us and bring more aboard!<br>
When from the ship there came a loud crash<br>
All jumped off board for it was all smash<br>
We looked all around to see alien snow<br>
With copper, and coal, and uranium all aglow!<br>
A factory to build in the cold winter land<br>
With your help it could be amazingly grand!<br>
Come join us this day at 12 UTC<br>
And build a factory for the whole world to see!
