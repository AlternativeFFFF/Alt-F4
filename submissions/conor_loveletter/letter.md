## I love Factorio because of Trains <author>Conor</author>

Whenever I play multiplayer Factorio (which is most of my play time), I’m always the one to build the trains. **ALWAYS**. We usually end up with massive bases all runnning over a train network that was hastily bodged together, but allows us (in conjuction with [TSM](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/train-pubsub)) to build simple production areas without having to fit all the parts together manually. Programmers will recognize this scenario as the *‘libary effect’*; it allows us to say thing like *‘Why would I care where iron plates are made? I’m just trying to make some damn red science packs.’*

Without trains, Factorio would be a mess of spaghetti-belts and chaotic pipes; trains bring order to the game. They are the single most important part of Factorio, as they allow us to build many different products without having to consider where every piece of plastic or iron comes from.
