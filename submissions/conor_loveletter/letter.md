### I love Factorio because... Trains!

Whenever I play multiplayer Factorio (which is most of my playtime), I always build the trains, **ALWAYS**. We usually end up with massive bases all runnning through a train network that was hastily bodged together but allows us (in conjuction with [TSM](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/train-pubsub)), to build simple production areas without having to fit all the parts together manually. Programmers will recognize this scenario as the *"libary effect"*, it allows us to say thing like *"Why would I care where Iron plates are made? I'm just trying to make some damn red packs"*. 

Without trains, Factorio would be a mess of long belts and pipe chaos, trains add order to the game. Trains are the single most important part of Factorio, they are what allow us to build so many different products without considering where every piece of plastic and iron plate come from.
