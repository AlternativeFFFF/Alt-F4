## I love Factorio because of Multiplayer <author>TheKool</author>

[[ Editors note: This one has quite a run-on sentence, but I've not managed to break it up. You decide on whether it's fine to keep or not. ]]

Most games are better with friends, and Factorio is a perfect example of this. The complexity of any given map and the many different tasks there are to be done makes it easier than any other game I've played for multiple people to contribute meaningfully to a common goal, instead of simply playing next to each other on the same map. This level of engagement is what finally inspired me to start streaming, and I hope it inspires others to connect with friends as well, old or new.
