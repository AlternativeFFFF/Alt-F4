## Factorio review - the best one I saw so far! <author>psihius</author>

While browsing the depths of YouTube, I have stumbled onto a fresh review of Factorio. Being the curious person I am, I like to see what authors have to say about the game. From time to time you run into something special, and this is the case here. 

All I will say, this is a Factorio addicts confession, the meta is strong and there are so many quotable lines. Enjoy!
