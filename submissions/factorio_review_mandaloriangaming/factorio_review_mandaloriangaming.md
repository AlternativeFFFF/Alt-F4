## Factorio review - the best one I saw so far! <author>psihius</author>

While browsing the depths of YouTube, I have stumbled onto a fresh review of Factorio, by [MandaloreGaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOGLGPOqlAiLmOvXW5lKbw). Being the curious person I am, I like to see what people have to say about the game. From time to time, you run into something special, and this is the case here for sure. All I will say is that this is a Factorio addict's confession; The meta jokes are strong and there are many quotable lines. Enjoy!
