If anyone is wondering what Minesweeper is about, well, it is a new map where base expansion happens by solving a *minesweeper* puzzle. To clear a mine, a furnace must be placed over it. Placing it over a clear spot will trigger an explosion, and stepping on it without clearing first will yield the same result. Mistakes cost dearly, as they release evil biters and cause nuclear explosions. Players can also earn *(or lose)* points depending on how good they are, and can compare themselves to others through a scoreboard that keeps a track of valuable internet points.

COMFY is one of the leading multiplayer Factorio communities and some of our [creations](https://github.com/M3wM3w/ComfyFactorio) are Mountain Fortress, Biter Battles, Fish Defense, Chronotrain and Cave Miner. And very, very soon it will include a map about pirates and sailing ships! Stay tuned for that one.

You can join the COMFY community with nearly 3500 members on our [Discord](https://getcomfy.eu/discord).
