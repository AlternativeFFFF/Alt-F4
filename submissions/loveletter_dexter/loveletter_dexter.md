## I love Factorio because of the Attention to Detail <author>Dexter of Rivia</author>

I love *Factorio* due to the love, and comittment to detail that has been placed into it. Every piece of the logistics puzzle fits together in it's own way. There are no hard constraints one how I build my factory, and there is no wrong way to go about it. *Factorio* is the first game I have played over the decades that truly lets you build your own sandbox from the ground up without the lack of direction, or feeling of cheating that many other sandbox games can bring. The first rocket launch in any map is only the beginning, and is when the game truly feels like it has opened up to me. Watching and experiencing *Factorio* grow and blossom over the last 8 years has been nothing short of wonderful, to see it come to fruition is surreal. Thank you for the years of hard work and dedication.
