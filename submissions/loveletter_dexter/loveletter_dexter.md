## I love Factorio because of the Attention to Detail <author>Dexter of Rivia</author>

I love Factorio because of the love and attention to detail that has been given to it. Every piece of the logistics puzzle fits together in its own way. There are no hard constraints on how I can build my factory, and there is no wrong way to go about it. Factorio is the first game I have played over the decades that truly lets you build your own sandbox from the ground up, without feeling like you lack direction or are given everything without working for it. The first rocket launch in any map is only the beginning, it's the point where the game truly opens up to me. Watching and experiencing the game grow and blossom over the last 8 years has been nothing short of wonderful, and to see it come to fruition is surreal. Thank you for the years of hard work and dedication.
