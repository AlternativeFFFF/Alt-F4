## Nauvis Archives: Update on Nauvis' Backstory <author>stringweasel</author>

In [Alt-F4 #9](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/#nauvis-our-home) we investigated the origins of the name of our planet Nauvis. A correction about the claim that the name is never actually shown in-game came soon after publication from IconCartographer. He pointed out that the name does indeed show up in specific instances when using either the editor or playing certain scenarios, instances where it's possible to have multiple surfaces. If a alert then occurs—for example the alert system that makes you aware of your buildings being damaged—it will display the surface name in the alert.

But more excitingly, after this discussion in the Factorio Discord, Wube Community Manager Klonan dug up some never seen before [backstory](https://discordapp.com/channels/139677590393716737/603392474458882065/766687476198539264) for us:

This is all you get:
```
The Cova System is named or the orange dwarf star at its centre. Four known planets orbit the star, as well ass numerous moons, unslisted dwarf planets and asteroids. Closest to the star is Nauvis - this is the planet upon which the game takes place. A temperate world capable of sustaining life.
```
And maybe this... <br/>
```The player, named Alden Winters...```

It seems like there were plans for an official Factorio story long ago, and in typical Wube fashion, it seems to be very detailed. However, this idea was scrapped and never implemented, which Klonan was [glad about](https://discordapp.com/channels/139677590393716737/603392474458882065/766688031687573565) in hindsight.

In the meantime though, if you're thirsty for some of that juicy Factorio lore, there are several players that have created their own [background story](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/4pr8z6/im_writing_a_free_live_factorio_fanfic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about how exactly the engineer got stranded on Nauvis.
