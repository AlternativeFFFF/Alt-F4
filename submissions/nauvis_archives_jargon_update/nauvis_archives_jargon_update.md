### Nauvis Archives Update: Nauvis' Backstory <author>stringweasel</author>

In [Alt-F4 #9](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/#nauvis-our-home) we investigated the origins of the name of our planet Nauvis. A correction about the claim that the name is never actually shown in-game came soon after publication from IconCartographer. He pointed out that the name does indeed show up. For one, it is used internally in the code to designate the main surface of the game. We were well aware of this fact, but decided not to include it as a normal player will not run into it in that way.

IconCartographer however did bring up a legit place where the name appears: The alert system that makes you aware of your buildings being damaged, for example. Factorio supports multiple surfaces, so it needs to specify where the alert happens if there is more than surface. This does not come up in the default sandbox game mode, so we missed it.

After this first was made in the Discord, Wube Community Manager Klonan dug up some never seen before [backstory](https://discordapp.com/channels/139677590393716737/603392474458882065/766687476198539264) for us to enjoy:

This is all you get:
```The cova system is named or the orange dwarf star at its centre. Four known planets orbit the star, as well ass numerous moons, unslisted dwarf planets and asteroids. Closest to the star is Nauvis - this is the planet upon which the game takes place. A tempered world capable of sustaining life.```
And maybe this... <br/>
```The player, named Alden Winters...```

It seems like there were plans for an official Factorio story long ago, and in typical Wube fashion, it seemed to be very detailed. However, this idea was scrapped and never implemented, which Klonan was [glad about](https://discordapp.com/channels/139677590393716737/603392474458882065/766688031687573565) in hindsight.

In the meantime though, several players have created their own [background story](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/4pr8z6/im_writing_a_free_live_factorio_fanfic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about how exactly the engineer got into this situation.
