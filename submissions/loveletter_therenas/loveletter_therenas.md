## I love Factorio because of Modding <author>Therenas</author>

I have played this game for many hundreds of hours. At some point I got into modding it, spending many more hours on it, replacing most of my play time since then. It's intoxicating to be able to actively modify one's favourite game, especially when the interface provided is so solid.

In many games you often have to hack your mod together with duct tape and a prayer, only to have it completely break with a minor update. With Factorio the developers actively fix problems that only mods encounter. They are also very receptive to community feedback. The game and modding interface are different in at least a dozen minor ways, just because I wrote two sentences on the forums asking for them to be.

In addition, the modding community itself is amazing, providing answers to every mod-related question on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2UQ9PcJ), writing [guides](https://github.com/raiguard/Factorio-SmallMods/wiki/GUI-Style-Guide), and keeping the [wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Modding_tutorial) updated.
