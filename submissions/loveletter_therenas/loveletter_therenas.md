## I love Factorio because of Modding <author>Therenas</author>

I played this game for many hundreds of hours. At some point, I got into modding it, spending many more hours on it, replacing most of my playtime since then. It's intoxicating to be able to actively modify one's favorite game, especially when the provided interface is so solid.

In many games, you often have to hack together your mod with duct tape and a prayer, only to have it completely break with a minor update. With Factorio, the developers actively fix problems that only mods encounter. They are also very receptive to community feedback. The game and modding interface is different in at least a dozen minor ways, just because I wrote two sentences on the forums asking for it to be.

In addition, the modding community itself is amazing, providing answers to every mod-related question on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2UQ9PcJ), writing [guides](https://github.com/raiguard/Factorio-SmallMods/wiki/GUI-Style-Guide) and keeping the [wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Modding_tutorial) updated.
