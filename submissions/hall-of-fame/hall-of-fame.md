## Mod Spotlight: [Hall of Fame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame) <author>Conor_</author>

Back in [FFF #362](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-362), *V453000* introduced us to the new main menu for Factorio: real-time simulations of the game running in the background, piggybacking off of the technology for the new and shiny [Tips and Tricks GUI](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-361). This was a great new feature, allowing for a much more interesting and spidertron-filled welcoming to the game.

Wube, of course, being the ~~godlike~~ fantastic humans they are, made it easy for anyone to create a mod that adds its own main menu simulations. Our very own *stringweasel* (Editor of the rockstars that write for Alt-F4) took this as a challenge (with a [little suggestion](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=520268#p520268) from forum user *conn11*) to continue his ongoing project of diving into the depths of Factorio of old (see Alt-F4's [#6](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-6/#nauvis-archives-how-far-weve-come-stringweasel), [#9](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/#nauvis-archives-factorio-jargon-stringweasel), [#11](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-11/#nauvis-archives-outdated-techniques-stringweasel), [#13](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-13/#nauvis-archives-one-rocket-defence-per-minute-stringweasel) and [#21](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-21/#nauvis-archives-from-mod-to-vanilla-stringweasel)).

With this historical pedigree as a foundation, the [Factorio Hall of Hame mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame) rose to glory, like a majestic phoenix, as if handed down from the heavens (totally not mixing metaphors there). *stringweasel* has sought out interesting Factorio maps from the archives of Reddit, the forums and the deep bowels of the internet, providing over 30 different base snapshots for us to enjoy as we load into the game. From speedruns to high SPM monsters, from spaghetti messes to beautifully laid out art pieces, and even a [burner inserter masterpiece](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-8/#i-love-factorio-because-of-burner-inserters-goose). Each map is painstakingly shrunk down and adapted from full working bases into small subsections, giving a glimpse into the essence and the character of these creations. I find myself loading up the game and pausing on the main menu for while, admiring a few interesting bases and getting inspired before I dive back into whatever spaghetti nightmare I left behind last session. Below is a small sneak peek into the awesomeness that is Hall of Fame but I recommend installing it for the full, arguably life-changing experience.
