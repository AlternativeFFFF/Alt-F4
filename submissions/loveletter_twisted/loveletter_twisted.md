## I love Factorio because of Optimization <author>Twisted_Code</author>

I love Factorio because of all the opportunities to optimize stuff. From circuit networks, to production lines, to base styles ([main bus or city block](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=37024)? Or maybe just throw it wherever it fits, if it works for you) and even to the [best logistic medium](https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Transport_use_cases) (of which there are some rather... [innovative](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=67977)... solutions), there's always something to improve.
