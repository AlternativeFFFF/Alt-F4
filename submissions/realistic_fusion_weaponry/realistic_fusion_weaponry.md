## Mod Spotlight: [Realistic Fusion Weaponry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionWeaponry) <author>Romner</author>

After I made the [power mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower), featured in [last weeks](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-4/#mod-spotlight-realistic-fusion-power-romner) issue of Alt-F4, I wondered if it's possible to use fusion for something else than just power production. Well, thermonuclear bombs are already a thing. Pure fusion bombs are theoretical, but I added them anyways. I'll let the gifs do the talking:

The order goes vanilla nuke > thermonuclear bomb > pure fusion bomb. The first gif shows vanilla-like explosions, while for the second one, I created kind of a meld of [MIRV](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/MIRV)'s and vanilla 1.0's explosions. I personally like the MIRV-like ones more, but if you don't, there's a setting for each bomb. There's also a setting to change the strength of the screen burn if it's too much for you.

I recently added antimatter to [Realistic Fusion Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower). Antimatter can be used for a lot of power production or for powerful weapons. *Very* powerful weapons. (Gif was sped up to account for UPS drops)

The antimatter bomb is only launchable as an artillery shell because there's no way you could survive after launching it from a handheld rocket launcher. Pure fusion and antimatter weaponry also has no critical mass (unlike fission and thermonuclear), which means they can be scaled down to practically any size. That includes:

Small rockets (and cannon shells which create the same explosion):

shotgun shells:

and even bullets!

There isn't a antimatter rocket/cannon shell GIF because it makes an explosion the same size as the pure fusion bomb.
And did I mention that all the nukes have artillery shell counterparts? Yes, even the vanilla one.

Also, you know flamethrowers, right? Well, why throw thousands of degrees hot flames when you can throw millions (or even billions!) of degrees hot plasma?

And yes, there's a plasma thrower turret too. They use either D or He-3 plasma (He-3 deals higher damage because of the 4x higher temperature). (Yes, I know plasma is just hot gas that would cool down very quickly, so in reality, it would just be a fart thrower but with the power of Scienceâ„¢, you managed to make it, well, *not* do that.)

Of course, all of this isn't cheap - there are several researches, costing 10k (plasma throwers), 20k (thermonuclear bomb), 50k (pure fusion bomb), 100k (small scale fusion weaponry), 500k (small scale antimatter weaponry) and 1M (antimatter bomb) science each. For comparison, the vanilla nuke needs 5k. Their recipes are also quite expensive: a single thermonuclear bomb needs 10k of the deuterium-tritium mixture + 25 u-235. That is 2TJ worth of fusion fuel and 2TJ of fission fuel. The pure fusion bomb needs 20k of the deuterium-helium-3 mixture, that's 20TJ worth of fusion fuel. The antimatter bomb uses 500 antihydrogen. That's ~386TJ. The vanilla nuke has 2.4TJ worth of fission fuel.

RFW is meant to be used against powerful modded enemies (like [Rampant](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rampant)'s), but you can of course use it with vanilla too (assuming you have [Realistic Fusion Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticFusionPower) installed, it's an addon to it after all).
