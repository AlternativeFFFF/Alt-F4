## Biter Battles Championships <author>everLord</author>

Saturday, the Biter Battles Championships start! Yeah!

### What are Biter Battles?

Biter Battles is a scenario created by MewMew from [Comfy's Factorio](https://getcomfy.eu/discord) where two teams compete while being attacked by biters whose goal is to destroy their silo. This means there is no direct player vs player combat, because players are separated by a river in our custom made battle arena.

Each team has to defend their silo from waves of biters attacking every other minute. You can also strengthen your opponent's biters by sending science packs to increase their tier (small, medium, big, behemoth) and how big the biter swarms are. Sending higher tiers will yield stronger mutagenic results. This scenario is open 24/7 for anyone to join! All you need to do is search for the public game "Free BiterBattles.org". It is usually the most populated public game, having between 20 and 50 players online most of the time.

### Then what are The Biter Battles Championships?

After four successful tournaments we decided to create a persistent competition on the Biter Battles scenario: A championship split into two leagues. The Behemoth league which will be for the pros, and the Biter league for everyone else. Matches are then 3v3, with an optional fourth player acting as spy, coach, or substitute.

It's played as a double round-robin: all teams in one division will fight twice against every other team of that division, once “at home”, once “away/visitor”. There are important twists to these games. The first aspect is four novelty starter packs which speed up the early game which leads to more dynamic matches and many possible strategies. The other important aspect is **Armageddon**: After two hours, the evolution of biters speeds up so that the match usually ends before three hours - to avoid endless games. So expect behemoths sooner than later!

Seven teams will compete in the Behemoth league. It will start tonight (Friday, 29th of October) with the main event being the clash between SteelAxe and GreenScience! You can expect some spectacular gameplay. It is definitely a very different show than regular Factorio. Matches will be streamed by popular streamers, and we will announce all matches and streams on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BiterBattles).

The Biter league on the other hand will start in two weeks. Everyone is very welcome to join and show their skills! Registration is still open until Monday, 8th of November. Each team will be required to play once per weekend, and player substitutions are allowed.
