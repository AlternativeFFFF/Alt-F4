The weekend is here, got any plans? Going to play Factorio for about 25 minutes again, then realise the sun is rising already? Or do you just want to play Factorio with a few friends?

Well, we've got some good news. This weekend, we have a few friends getting together to do something simple: completely melt our server's silicon! Join us for the Molten Silicon event where our only objective is to get as many players onto a server as possible and launch a rocket. Oh, and melt the servers CPU at the same time of course! There will be something for every player to do, from build a base to clearing biters with other red coats. Our true enemy will probably be everpresent as well, so we'll need some of you to join our lumberjack team!

So if you got a few hours to spare this weekend, and want to try and break the [previous record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEhPra7M-Wg) of 521 concurrent players, please join our server at 11am UTC this Saturday 5th of September. You can easily identify it, because it'll be the largest server running!
