## I love Factorio because of the Community <author>ironic toblerone</author>

What do I love most about Factorio? That's easy: The Community! I have been a part of the Factorio community for well over three years already. I started playing way back in 0.16, where nuclear didn't exist, bots were still overpowered, and because I was terrible at signaling, my trains kept crashing into each other. Sorry about that, trains. I love how the community has grown and come up with many great ideas such as the [ray-casting engine](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-6/#facto-rayo-v20-arrow-in-my-gluteus-maximus), the [blood belt](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/7db6hn/blöodbüs_where_homeostasis_hits_the_metal/), and many other concepts that I could not have thought possible in Factorio. The community has come up with so many amazing things that are incredible to watch and explore, keeping me engaged and blowing my mind on a regular basis.
